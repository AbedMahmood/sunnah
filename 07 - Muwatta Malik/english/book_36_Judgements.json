    "text": "Malik related to me from Yazid ibn Abdullah ibn al-Hadi from Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn al-Harith at-Taymi from Sulayman ibn Yasar from Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya that a woman's husband died, and she did the idda of four months and ten days. Then she married when she was free to marry. She stayed with her husband for four and a half months, then gave birth to a fully developed child. Her husband went to Umar ibn al-Khattab and mentioned that to him, so Umar called some of the old women of the Jahiliyya and asked them about that. One of the women said, \"I will tell you what happened with this woman. When her husband died, she was pregnant by him, but then the blood flowed from her because of his death and the child became dry in her womb. When her new husband had intercourse with her and the water reached the child, the child moved in the womb and grew.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab believed her and separated them (until she had completed her idda). Umar said, \"Only good has reached me about you two,\" and he connected the child to the first husband."

The scrutinizer said, \"They both share in him.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab hit him with a whip. Then he summoned the woman, and said, \"Tell me your tale.\" She said, \"It was this one (indicating one of the two men) who used to come to me while I was with my people's camels. He did not leave me until he thought and I thought that I was pregnant. Then he left me, and blood flowed from me, and this other one took his place. I do not know from which of them the child is.\" The scrutinizer said, \"Allah is greater.\" Umar said to the child, \"Go to whichever of them you wish.\""
