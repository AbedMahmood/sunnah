In the day, they used to bring water and pour it in pitchers in the mosque, then they would collect wood and sell it; and with the sale proceeds, they would buy food for the people of As-Suffah and the needy. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent the reciters with these people but these (treacherous people) fell upon them and killed them before they reached their destination. (While dying) they supplicated: \"O Allah convey from us the news to our Prophet that we have met You (in a way), that we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us.\" (The narrator said:) A man attacked Haram from behind and smote him with a spear which pierced him. Whereupon Haram said: \"By the Rubb of Ka'bah, I have met with success. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his Companions, \"Your brethren have been slain and they were saying: \"O Allah!
