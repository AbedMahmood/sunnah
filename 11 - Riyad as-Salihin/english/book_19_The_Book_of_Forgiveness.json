    "text": "Suhaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"When the inhabitants of Jannah enter Jannah, Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, will say to them: 'Do you wish me to give you anything more?' They will reply: 'Have You not made our faces bright? Have You not brought us into Jannah and delivered us from the Hell?' And Allah will remove the Veil. The (dwellers of Jannah) will feel that they have not been awarded anything dearer to them than looking at their Rubb.\"\n\n[Muslim].\n\nAllah, the Exalted, says:\n\n\"Verily, those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, their Rubb will guide them through their Faith; under them will flow rivers in the Gardens of Delight (Jannah). Their way of request therein will be Subhanaka Allahumma (Glory to You, O Allah!) and Salam (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein (Jannah)! and the close of their request will be: Al-hamdu lillahi Rabbil-'Alamin [All the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Rubb of 'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)].\" (10:9,10)"
