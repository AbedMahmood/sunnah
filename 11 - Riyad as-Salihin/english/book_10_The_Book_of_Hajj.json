Then he (ﷺ) said, \"Had I replied in the affirmative, it would have surely become obligatory, and you would not have been able to fulfill it.\" Afterwards he said, \"Do not ask me so long as I do not impose anything upon you, because those who were before you were destroyed on account of their frequent questioning and their disagreement with their Prophets. So when I order you to do something, do it as far as you can; and when I forbid you from doing anything, eschew it.\"\n\n[Muslim]."
