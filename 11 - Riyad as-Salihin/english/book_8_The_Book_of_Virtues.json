Next morning the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked me, \"What did your prisoner do last night.\" I answered, \"He promised to teach me some words which he claimed will benefit me before Allah. So I let him go.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked, \"What are those words that he taught you?\" I said, \"He told me: 'When you go to bed, recite Ayat- ul-Kursi from the beginning to the end i.e.,[ Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi encompasses the heavens and the earth, and preserving them does not fatigue Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Great].' (2:255). He added: 'By reciting it, there will be a guardian appointed over you from Allah who will protect you during the night, and Satan will not be able to come near you until morning'.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Verily, he has told you the truth though he is a liar. O Abu Hurairah! Do you know with whom you were speaking for the last three nights?\" I said, \"No.\" He (ﷺ) said, \"He was Shaitan (Satan).\"\n\n[Al-Bukhari]."

I thought that he would go in Ruku' (bowing posture in Salat) at the end of one hundred Ayat, but he continued (reciting); and I thought that he would perhaps recite (this Surah) in the whole Rak'ah (prayer), but he continued the recitation; I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this Surah). He (ﷺ) then started reciting Surat An-Nisa' which he followed with Surat Al-Imran. He recited leisurely. When he recited an Ayah which mentioned the tasbeeh, he would say Subhan Allah and when he recited the Ayah which tells how the Rubb is to be asked, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would then ask from Him; and when he (ﷺ) recited an Ayah asking one to seek Protection Allah, he would seek Protection of Allah. Then he bowed and said, \"Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim (My Rubb the Great is free from imperfection)\"; his bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing, (and then on returning to the standing posture after Ruku') he would say, \"Sami' Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana lakal-hamd (Allah listens to him who praises Him. Praise be to You, Our Rubb!),\" and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say, \"Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la (My Rubb the Supreme is free from imperfection),\" and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing (Qiyam).\n\n[Muslim]."

The inquirer asked: \"Am I obliged to pay anything besides this?\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"No, but whatever you pay voluntarily out of your own free will.\" That man turned back saying: \"By Allah! I will neither make any addition to this nor will I decrease anything from it.\" (Upon hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked, \"He is successful if he proves truthful (to what he is saying).\"\n\n[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]."

When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to Hell.\" It was asked, \"How about someone who owns camels and does not pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?\" He (ﷺ) replied, \"In the same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.\" It was (again) asked: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?\" He (ﷺ) said, \"If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.\" It was asked: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?\" Upon this he (ﷺ) said, \"The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner. When their owner leads them through a stream from which they drink, though he does not intend to quench their thirst, yet Allah would record for him the quantity (of water) of what they would drink on his behalf as good deeds.\" It was asked: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about the donkeys?\" Upon this he (ﷺ) said, \"Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the donkeys in particular except this one Verse of a comprehensive nature: \"So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.\"' (99: 8,9).\n\n[Al- Bukhari and Muslim]."

Fasting is a shield. When anyone of you is observing fast, he should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice; and if anyone reviles him or tries to quarrel with him, he should say: 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hand the soul of Muhammad is, the breath of one observing Saum is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk. The one who fasts, experiences two joys: he feels pleasure when he breaks the fast. He is joyful by virtue of his fast when he meets his Rubb.\"\n\n[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].\n\nIn a narration by Al-Bukhari, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Allah says: '(The person observing Saum) has abstained from food and drink, and sexual pleasures for My sake; fasting is for Me, and I will bestow its reward. Every good deed has ten times its reward'.\"\n\nIn a narration by Muslim, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"The reward of every (good) deed of a person is multiplied from ten to seven hundred times. Allah (SWT) says: 'The reward of observing Saum is different from the reward of other good deeds; Saum is for Me, and I Alone will give its reward. The person observing Saum abstains from food and drink only for My sake.' The fasting person has two joyous occasions, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time of meeting his Rubb. Surely, the breath of one observing Saum is better smelling to Allah than the fragrance of musk.\""
