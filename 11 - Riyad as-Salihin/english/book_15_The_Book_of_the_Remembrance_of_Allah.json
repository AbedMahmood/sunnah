Thereupon the Prophet said, \"I recited four words three times after I had left you. If these are to be weighed against all you have recited since morning, these will be heavier.

They say, 'They beg You for Your Jannah.' Allah says, 'Have they seen My Jannah?' They say, 'No, our Rubb.' He says: 'How would they act if they were to see My Jannah?'
