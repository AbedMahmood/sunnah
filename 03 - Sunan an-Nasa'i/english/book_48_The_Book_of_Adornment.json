Abu Hashim wept. Mu'awiyah said to him: 'Why are you weeping? Is it because of some pain that is hurting you, or is it for this world, the best of which has gone?' He said: 'Neither, but the Messenger of Allah [SAW] gave me some advice, which I wish that I had followed. He said: \"Perhaps you will live to see wealth that will be distributed among the people when all that would suffice you of that would be a servant and a mount to ride in the cause of Allah.\" I lived to see that, and I accumulated (wealth).'\""
