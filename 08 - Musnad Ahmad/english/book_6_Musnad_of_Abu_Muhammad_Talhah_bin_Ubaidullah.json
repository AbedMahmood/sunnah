But I will go out with you and sit with you. Offer your camels for sale and if a man comes and makes you an offer and I think he is honest and sincere, I will tell you to sell to him. So we went out to the marketplace and showed the mounts that we had for sale, and Talhah sat nearby. People made offers to us, then when a man offered what we wanted, my father said to Talhah: “Shall I sell to him?” He said: “Yes, I am sure he is honest. So sell to him.” So we sold to him. Then when we took our money and ended our business, my father said to Talhah: “Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for a document for us, stating that no one should transgress against us with regard to our zakah.” (Talhah) said: “This is your right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “Nevertheless, I would like to have a document from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ).” So he took us out and brought us to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), this man is a man of the desert and is a friend of ours. He would like you to write a document for him, stating that no one should transgress against him with regard to his zakah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `That is his right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “O, Messenger of Allah, he would like to have something from you in writing concerning that.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote this document for us.”"
