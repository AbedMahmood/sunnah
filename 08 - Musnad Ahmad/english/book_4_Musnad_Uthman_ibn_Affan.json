    "text": "It was narrated that Yazeed said:\nIbn ‘Abbas (رضي الله عنه) said to us. I said to ‘Uthman bin `Affan: What made you take al-Anfal, which is one of al-Mathani (the seven long soorahs), and Bara`ah, which is one of al-Mi`een (soorahs with one hundred verses or thereabouts), and put them next to one another and not write - Ibn Ja`far said: A line between them saying Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem - and you put them with the seven long ones? What made you do that? `Uthman (رضي الله عنه)said: Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: “Put this in the Soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned”; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.” Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the stories and content of the two soorahs were similar. \nThen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away without having stated clearly to us that it was part of it, but we thought that it was, hence I put them together and I did not put between them the line Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem. Ibn Ja`far said: I put it with the seven long ones."

What made you do that? `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said. Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: `Put this in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.` Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the content of the two soorahs was similar. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away without having stated clearly to us that it was part of it, but we thought that it was, hence I put them together and I did not put between them the line Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem, and I put it with the seven long ones."

And I saw `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) look out of the window beside the place where Jibreel (عليه السلام) once stood, and he said: O people, is Talhah among you? They kept quiet. Then he said: O people, is Talhah among you? They kept quiet. Then he said: O people, is Talhah among you? Talhah bin `Ubaidullah stood up and ‘Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said to him: Are you there? I did not think that you would be in a group of people, hearing me call you three times and not answering me. I adjure you by Allah, O Talhah, do you remember the day when you and I were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in such and such a place, and none of his Companions were with him except you and I. He said: Yes, [`Uthman said:] And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to you: `O Talhah, there is no Prophet but he had a companion from among his ummah who will be with him in Paradise, and this `Uthman bin `Affan (رضي الله عنه)` - meaning me - `is that companion who will be with me in Paradise.” Talhah said: By Allah, yes [I remember that]. Then he went away."

But Allah, indeed, has forgiven them.` [Al ‘Imran 3:155]?
