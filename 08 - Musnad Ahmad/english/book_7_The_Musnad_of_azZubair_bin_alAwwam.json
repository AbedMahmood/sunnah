She shoved me in the chest, and she was a tough woman.” She said: “Stay away from me, may you have no land!” I said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is urging you (not to go and see them).” She stopped and took out two pieces of cloth that she had with her and said: “These are two pieces of cloth that I have brought for my brother Hamzah. I have heard that he has been killed; shroud him with them.” We brought the two pieces of cloth to shroud Hamzah with them, but we saw beside him one of the Ansar who had been killed, and the same had been done to him as to Hamzah. We did not feel it was appropriate to shroud Hamzah in two pieces of cloth and to leave the Ansari with no shroud, so we said: “One piece for Hamzah and one piece for the Ansari.” We measured (the pieces of cloth) and found that one of them was larger, so we drew lots between them and shrouded each of them in the piece of cloth that was selected for him."

The Prophet (ﷺ) said to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه): `Water (your trees), then let the water flow to your neighbour.` The Ansari got angry and said: “O Messenger of Allah, it is because he is your cousin!” The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed colour, then he said to az-Zubair: “Water (your trees), then block the water until it backs up to the bottom of the wall.” So the Prophet (ﷺ) told az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) to take all of his rights in full. Before that, the Prophet (ﷺ) had suggested to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) something that would be good for both him and the Ansari, but when the Ansari annoyed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he told az-Zubair to take his rights in full in a clear ruling. `Urwah said: “az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, I think that this verse was revealed concerning that: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (ﷺ)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission` (an-Nisa` [4:65]).”"
