He then bowed and they also bowed, and he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he raised his head and they also raised (their heads). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then remained seated. They prostrated alone and stood up and retraced their footsteps and stood behind them.\nThen the other section came; they stood up and uttered the takbir and bowed by themselves. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prostrated himself and they also prostrated with him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and they performed the second prostration by themselves. Then both the sections stood up and prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He bowed and they also bowed, and then he prostrated himself and they also prostrated themselves. Then he returned and performed the second prostration and they also prostrated with him as quickly as possible, showing no slackness in quick prostration. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then uttered the salutation. After that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up. Thus everyone participated in the entire prayer."
