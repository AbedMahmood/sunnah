This version has the traditional word “a menstrual course” in the phrase “till she is free from a menstrual course”. This is a misunderstanding on the part of the narrator Abu Mu’awiyah. This is correct in the tradition of Abu Sa’id Al Khudri. This version has the additional words “he who believes in Allaah and the Last Day should not ride on a mount belonging to the spoil of Muslims and when he makes it emaciated returns it; he who believes in Allaah and the Last Day should not put on cloth belonging to the spoils of Muslims and when makes it old (shabby) returns it.\nAbu Dawud said “The word “menstrual course” is not guarded. This is a misunderstanding on the part of Abu Mu’awiyah”\n\nThe aforesaid tradition has also been transmitted by Ibn Ishaq through a different chain of narrators. This version has the traditional word “a menstrual course” in the phrase “till she is free from a menstrual course”. This is a misunderstanding on the part of the narrator Abu Mu’awiyah. This is correct in the tradition of Abu Sa’id Al Khudri.
