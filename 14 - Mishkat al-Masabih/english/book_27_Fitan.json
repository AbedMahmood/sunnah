He told them that faith had come down into the roots of men's hearts, then they gained knowledge from the Qur'an, then gained knowledge from the sunnah. He also told about its removal, saying, \"A man will sleep[2] and faith will be taken from his heart, but its mark will remain like the mark of a spot. He will sleep again, and it will be taken away, its mark remaining like the mark of a blister, as when you drop live coals over your foot a water blister is produced and you see it swollen with nothing in it. People will make business agreements with one another and scarcely one will fulfil his trust. It will then be said that among the B. so and so there is a trustworthy man. People will remark how intelligent, excellent, and resolute a man is while he has not as much faith in his heart as a grain of mustard seed.\" \n1. Fitan pl of fitnah.

Lisan al-'Arab, 6:432, says her offspring were the Turks, and some say the negroes. Mirqat, 5:166 f., finds a difficulty because Abraham was a descendant of Shem and the Turks were descended from Japheth. It suggests that Qantura' was a descendant of Abraham who married a descendant of Japheth. Dr. J.A. Boyle of Manchester University has drawn my attention to an article in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 12:287, which quotes an Armenian historian, Grigor of Akner (1250-1335 A.D.), as saying that Kendura, a handmaiden of Abraham, bore Imran who became the ancestor of the Parthians."

Telling me to relate it, and remarking that I was daring, he asked how he had spoken and I replied that I had heard God's messenger say, \"A man's fitna concerns his family, his property, his person, his children and his neighbour for any shortcoming in which atonement made by fasting, prayer, sadaqah recommending what is reputable and reproving what is disreputable.[1] `Umar said that this was not what he meant, for he was thinking of the fitna which swells like the waves of the sea.[2] I asked the commander of the faithful what he had to do with it, for between him and it there was a closed door. He asked whether the door would be broken down or opened, and when I replied that it would be broken down, he said it would never likely be closed. Hudhaifa was asked if `Umar knew who the door was and he replied that he knew it as well as he knew that a night comes before tomorrow, adding that he had told him a tradition which included no misleading language. They were afraid to ask Hudhaifa who the door was, so they asked Masruq to ask him, and when he did so he replied that it was `Umar.3 \n A man who has these responsibilities may fall short of what is due from him, but can make atonement for his shortcoming. \n Contention which leads to strife and warfare. \n The point of the tradition is that the fitna would not occur in `Umar's lifetime, but that as he was to be assassinated there was no hope of peaceful conditions ever returning. The opening of the door indicates a natural death and the breaking down of the door a violent death.\n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

The rider who came from the Yemen brought him a handful and scattered it in front of him, and when `Umar saw it, he said, \"God is most great,\" and told that he had heard God's messenger say, \"God who is great and glorious created a thousand species, six hundred in the sea and four hundred on the land.

    "text": "An-Nawwas b. Sam`a.n told that God's messenger mentioned the dajjal saying, \"If he comes forth while I am among you I shall be the one who will dispute with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth when I am not among you a man must dispute on his own behalf, and God will take my place in looking after every Muslim. He will be a youth with curly hair and a floating eye whom I might compare to `Abd al- `Uzza b. Qatan. Those of you who live till his time should recite over him the opening verses of sura al-Kahf[1] (a version having `should recite over him the opening verses of sura al-Kahf, for they are your protection from his trial'). He will come forth on a road between Syria and al- `Iraq and do mischief right and left. Stand firm, servants of God.\" God's messenger was asked how long he would remain in the earth and replied, \"Forty days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and the rest of his days like yours.\" God's messenger was then asked if one day's prayer would suffice them in that day which would be like a year and replied, \"No, you must make an estimate of its extent.\" He was asked how quickly he would go in the earth and replied, \"Like rain driven along by the wind. He will come to people and summon them and they will believe in him. He will then give command to the sky and it will give rain and to the earth and it will produce crops. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps as high as possible; their udders full of milk, and their flanks distended. He will then come to people and summon them, but they will reject what he says, so he will leave them. In the morning they will be destitute, possessing none of their property. He will pass the waste land and tell it to bring forth its treasures, and its treasures will follow him like swarms of bees. He will then summon a man in the prime of youth, strike him with a sword and cut him in two like a shot at a target, after which he will call him and he will come forward laughing with his face shining. But at that very moment God will send the Messiah son of Mary who will descend at the white minaret in the east of Damascus wearing two garments dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, it will drip and when he raises it beads like pearls will scatter from it. Every infidel who feels the odour of his breath will die, and his breath will reach as far as he can see. He will then seek him till he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd and kills him. People whom God has protected from him will then come to Jesus who will wipe their faces and tell them of the ranks they will have in paradise. While this is happening God will reveal to Jesus that He has brought forth servants of His with whom no one will be able to fight and tell him to collect His servants at at-Tur. God will then release Gog and Magog and they will swarm down from every slope.' [2] The first of them will pass the lake of Tiberias and drink its contents and when the last[3] of them passes he will say there was once water there. They will then journey till they come to the mountain of thickets which is the mountain of Jerusalem and will say, `We have killed those who are in the earth come and let us kill those who are in heaven.' They will then shoot their arrows into the sky and God will send their arrows back to them dyed with blood; and God's prophet and his companions will be restrained till an ox-head seems better to one of them than a hundred dinars do to you to-day. God's prophet Jesus and his companions will then beseech God who will send to them insects in their necks and in the morning, they will have perished as if they were one person. God's prophet Jesus and his companions will then come down to the earth and will not find in the earth as much space as a span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. God's prophet Jesus and his companions will then beseech God who will send birds with necks like those of Bactrian camels and they will carry them and throw them where God wills. (A version says they will throw them in an-Nahbal[4] and the Muslims will burn their bows, arrows, and quivers for seven years.) God will then send a rain which no house of clay or camel's wool will keep out and it will wash the earth till it leaves it like a mirror. The earth will then be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing, and on that day a company of people will eat a pomegranate and seek shelter in its skin, and the milk will be blessed so that a milch-camel will be sufficient for a number of people, a cow in milk will be sufficient for a tribe of men and a ewe will be sufficient for a clan of men. At that time God will send a pleasant wind which will take them under their arm pits and the spirit of every believer and every Muslim will be taken, but the wicked people will remain in the earth and will be disorderly like asses. Then the last hour will come to them.\" \n1-Quran, 18. \n2-Quran, 21:96. \n3-In the Arabic of this sentence the plural is used for 'first' and the singular for `last.' \n4-This appears as a proper name in the tradition, but Taj al-arus in the article hbl says this is an error for al-mahbal which means a great pit. Cf also Ibn al-Athir, Nihaya, 4:252.\n\n\n\nMuslim transmitted it, except for the second version which is \"They will throw them into an-Nahbal... seven years.\" That is transmitted by Tirmidhi."

    "text": "Fatima, daughter of Qais told that she had heard God's messenger's crier calling to congregational prayer, so she went out to the mosque and prayed along with God's messenger. When he had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit laughing and told everyone to remain where he had said the prayer. He then asked them if they knew why he had assembled them, and when they replied that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"I swear by God that I have not assembled you for some pleasant purpose or because of fear, but I have assembled you because Tamim ad-Dari, a Christian who came and accepted Islam, told me something which agrees with what I was telling you about the antichrist. He told me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Lakhm and Judham and that they were storm-tossed for a month. They drew near to an island when the sun was setting and going into the ship's small boats they went ashore where they were met by a very hairy beast whose hair was so abundant that because of it they could not tell its front from its back. They said, `Woe to you! What can you be?' and it replied, `I am the Jassasa.1 Go to this man in the monastery, for he is anxious to get news of you.' He said that when it named a man to them, they were afraid of it lest it should be a she-devil so they went off quickly and entered the monastery where they found a man with the hugest and strongest frame they had ever seen with his hand joined to his neck and in irons from the knees to the ankles. They said, `Woe to you! Who are you?' and he replied that they had had the opportunity of knowing about him, so they must tell him who they were. They said they were Arabs who had sailed in a ship and after having been storm-tossed for a month had landed on the island where they were met by a very hairy beast which informed them that it was the jassasa and told them to go to this man in the monastery, so they had come to him quickly. He asked them to tell him about the palm trees of Baisan whether they were producing fruit, and when they told him that they were, he said they would soon cease to bear fruit. He asked them to tell him about the lake of Tiberias whether there was water in it, and when they replied that it contained a great quantity of water he said that its water, would soon disappear. He asked them to tell him about the spring of Zughar[2] whether there was any water in the spring and whether the people carried on agriculture with the spring water, to which they replied that it had a great quantity of water and that its people carried on agriculture with its water. He asked them to tell him what had happened to the prophet of the Gentiles and they told him he had left Mecca and settled in Yathrib. He asked whether the Arabs had fought with him and when they replied that they had, he asked how he had dealt with them and they replied that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had obeyed him. Saying it would be best for them to obey him, he told them that he would now inform them about himself. He Poundaid he was the antichrist and would soon be permitted to come forth. He would then come forth and travel in the earth for forty nights, not leaving a town unvisited except Mecca and Taiba[3] both of which are forbidden to him, for as often as he wanted to enter one of them he would be faced by an angel with a drawn sword in his hand who would turn him away from it, and on every one of its mountain paths there would be angels guarding it.\" Then striking the pulpit with the end of his staff, God's messenger said, \"This is Taiba, this is Taiba, this is Taiba (meaning Medina). Have J told you [a story like this]?\" On their replying that he had, he said, \"I assure you that he is in the Syrian sea or the Yemen Sea; no, on the contrary, it is towards the East that he is and he pointed his hand to the East. \n1. The name of a beast which is to seek for news to take to the dajjal.\n2. Different explanations are given of this name. It is said to have been a spring in the Balqa in Syria and to have been connected with a daughter of Lot.\n3. A name for Medina.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."

He had combed it out, and it was dripping with water. He was leaning on the shoulders of two men and going round the House. When I asked who he was I was told that he was the Messiah, son of Mary. Then I saw a man with short, woolly hair who was blind in the right eye, his eye looking like a floating grape. I have never seen anyone more closely resembling Ibn Qatan. He was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men and going round the House. I asked who this man was and was told that he was the antichrist.\" In a version he said about the dajjal that he was a red, fleshy man with woolly hair, blind in the right eye, Ibn Qatan being the one who resembled him most closely. \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

One of the severest of his afflictions will be his coming to a nomadic Arab and saying, `Tell me, if I bring your camels to life for you, will you not know that I am your Lord?' and he will reply, `Certainly. He will then make the devils appear to him like his camels with the finest udders and the highest humps. He will come to a man whose brother and father have died and say, `Tell me, if I bring your father and your brother to life for you, will you not know that I am your Lord?' and he will reply, `Certainly.' He will then make the devils appear to him like his father and his brother.\" She said that God's messenger then went out to relieve himself and when he found on his return that the people were greatly upset over what he had told them, he put his hands on the sides of the door and said, \"What is the matter, Asma'?\" When she replied that their hearts were perturbed over them; mention of the dajjal, he said, \"If he comes forth when I am alive, I shall dispute with him, otherwise my Lord will take my place on behalf of every believer.\" She said, \"Messenger of God, I swear by God that when we knead our dough, we are hungry before we make it into bread. Now how will believers fare at that time?\" He replied, \"The glorifying of God and the declaration of His holiness which are enough for the angels will be enough for them.\"\n\n ...Transmitted it.

Maghala, Ibn Sayyid at that time being near the age of puberty. Before he was aware God's messenger gave him a clap on the back and said, \"Do you testify that I am God's messenger?\" He looked at him and said, \"I testify that you are the messenger of the Gentiles,\" after which Ibn Sayyad said, \"Do you testify that I am God's messenger?\" The Prophet squeezed him and said, \"I believe in God and His messengers.\" He then asked Ibn Sayyad what visions he had, and when he replied, \"One who speaks the truth and one who lies comes to me,\" God's messenger said, \"You are confused.\" He then said, \"I have concealed something in my mind which I would like you to tell me\" (referring to \"the day when the sky will bring forth smoke (dukhan) clearly visible\").[1] On his replying, \"It is smoke (dukhkh),\" he said, \n\"Away with you! You cannot get farther than your rank.\"[2] `Umar then asked God's messenger if he would permit him to cut off his head, but he replied, \"If he is the one[3] you will not be given power over him, and if he is not, you will not do well in killing him.\" Ibn `Umar told that sometime afterwards God's messenger and Ubayy b. Ka'b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyid was, and God's messenger hid behind the palm trunks seeking stealthily to hear something from Ibn Sayyid before he could see him. Ibn Sayyid was lying on his bed in a wrapper from which a murmur issued, and when his mother saw the Prophet hiding behind the palm trunks she said, \"Saf '(that being his name), here is Muhammad,\" whereupon Ibn Sayyad stopped the murmuring, and God's messenger said, \"If you had left him alone, he would have made things clear.\" `Abdallah b. `Umar told that God's messenger stood up among the people, and when he had extolled God - in a fitting manner he mentioned the dajjal and said, \"I warn you of him, and there is no prophet who has not warned his people. Noah warned his people, but I shall tell you something about him which no prophet has told his people. You must know that he is one-eyed, whereas God is not one-eyed.\"\n1. Quran, 44:10. \n2. The idea is that Ibn Sayyid was being tested to see whether he had any supernatural knowledge of what the Prophet had in mind. His use of a different form of the word for smoke put him on the level of a kahin with a defective source of information. \n3. i.e., the dajjal. \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Mas'ud who will search for him and destroy him. He will remain among mankind for seven years, during which period no two people will be at enmity with one another. God will then send a cold wind from the direction of Syria, and no one who has in his heart as much as a grain of good (or faith) will remain on the earth without being taken, and even if one of you had entered the interior of a mountain it would come in where he was and take him. The wicked will remain as unstable as birds and with the intelligence of beasts of prey,[1] neither acknowledging what is reputable nor rejecting what is disreputable. The devil will then appear to them and ask them if they are not ashamed, and when they ask him what he commands them to do he will order them to worship idols. While they are doing so and enjoying abundant provision and a pleasant life the trumpet will be blown and everyone who hears it will bend one side of his neck and raise the other. The first to hear it will be a man who is plastering the tank used for his camels, and he and mankind will fall dead. God will then send a rain-like dew by which He will make the bodies of men to sprout from the ground. Then a second blast will be blown and they will be standing and looking.[2] Mankind will then be summoned to come to their Lord and the angels will be told to restrain them for they are to be questioned. Command will then be given to bring forth those who are to go to hell, and when they ask what proportion is to be brought forth they will be told it is nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand. That will be a day which will make children grey-haired,[3] and that will be a day when the leg will be bared.\"[4] \n1. They are like birds in being easily startled, showing lack of stability and inclination to wickedness; they have as little intelligence as wild beasts, showing anger and violence. \n2. Cf. Quran, 39:68. Here the imperfect of the verb is used instead of the perfect used in the Quran. Otherwise, the wording is the same. \n3. Cf. Quran, 73:17. \n4. Cf. Quran, 68:42. A figure of speech for great affliction.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."
