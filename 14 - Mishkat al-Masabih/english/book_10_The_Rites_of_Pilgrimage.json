Then he said, “If I were to say that it should, it would be obligatory and you would not be able to perform it,” after which he said, “Leave me alone as long as I have said nothing to you, for your predecessors perished simply on account of their much questioning and their disagreement with their prophets. But when I command you to do anything, obey it as much as you can; and when I forbid you to do anything, leave it alone.”\n\nMuslim transmitted it."

    "text": "Jabir b. ‘Abdallah said: God’s messenger remained in Medina nine years, during which he had not performed the hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that God’s messenger was about to perform the hajj. Large numbers came to Medina, and we went out with him. When we reached Dhul Hulaifa, Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais, gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr and sent to God’s messenger asking what she was to do. He replied, “Bathe, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and put on the ihram.” God’s messenger then prayed in the mosque, and after he had mounted al-Qaswa' and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida’, he raised his voice declaring God’s unity and saying, “Labbaik, O God, labbaik labbaik; Thou hast no partner; labbaik; praise and grace are Thine and the dominion; Thou hast no partner.” Jabir said : We did not express our intention of performing anything but the hajj, being unaware of the ‘umra [at that season], but when we came with him to the House he touched the corner and made seven circuits, running three of them and walking four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham, he recited, “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (Qur’an 2:125)He then prayed two 'rak'as, having the station between him and the House. A version says that he recited in the two rak'as,. “Say, He is God, One,” and, “Say, O infidels.” (Qur’an 112, and 109) He then returned to the corner and touched it, after which he went out by the gate to as-Safa, on coming near to which he recited. “As-Safa and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by God,” (Qur’an 2:158) adding, “I begin with what God began with.” So he went first to as-Safa, and mounting it till he could see the House, he faced the qibla, declared God's unity, proclaimed His greatness, and said, “There is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent; there is no god but God alone who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates.\" He then made supplication in the course of that, saying such words three times. He next descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at as-Safa, and when he came to al-Marwa for the last time, he called out, he being on al-Marwa and the people below him, saying, “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding my religion, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an 'umra ; so if any of you has no sacrificial animals he,may take off the ihram and treat it as an ‘umra. Suraqa b. Malik b.Jush'um then got up and asked, “Messenger of God, does this apply to the present year, or does it apply for ever?\" God’s messenger intertwined his fingers and said twice, “The ‘umra has become incorporated in the hajj,\" adding “No, but for ever and ever.\" ‘Ali came from the Yemen with the Prophet’s sacrificial animals and he asked him what he had said when he undertook the duty of performing the hajj. He replied that he had said, “0 God, I am putting on the ihram for the same purpose as Thy messenger has put it on.\" He said, “I have with me the sacrificial animals, so do not put off the ihram.” [Jabir] said: The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet was a hundred. Then all the people, except the Prophet and those who had with them sacrificial animals, removed the ihram and clipped their hair. When yaum at-tarwiya (The 8th of Dhul Hijja, the day when pilgrims leave Mecca and go to Mina. The name is commonly explained as meaning that this was the day when the pilgrims provided themselves with a supply of water for the arid journey before them) came they went towards Mina having put on the ihram for the hajj, and the Prophet rode and prayed there the noon, afternoon, sunset, evening and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose, and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up for him at Namira (A place or a hill near ‘Arafa). God’s messenger then set out, and Quraish did not doubt that he would observe a halt at the sacred site (At al-Muzdalifa, al-Mash'ar al-haram, a hill sacred to the god Ouzah in pre-lslamic times), as Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period ; but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafa and found that the tent had been set up for him at Namira. There he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered al- Qaswa’ to be brought, and when it was saddled for him he went down into the valley and addressed the people, saying, “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Everything pertaining to the pre-Islamic period has been put under my feet, and claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-lslamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood-vengeance I remit is the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith (Rabi’a was a grandson of 'Abd al-Muttalib. The name of the child who had been killed is variously given as Adam, Tammam and Iyas. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr says Adam is a mistake, but does not commit himself to either of the other two names) who was suckled among the B. Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Show fear towards God regarding women, for you have got them under God’s security, and have the right to intercourse with them by God's word. They must not bring into your houses anyone whom you dislike, but if they do that beat them, though not severely. You are responsible for providing them with their food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, i.e. God’s Book, by which, if you hold to it, you will never again go astray. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?\" They replied, “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. ” Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said, “O God, be witness ; O God, be witness,” saying it three times. Bilal then uttered the call to prayer, and the iqama, and he prayed the noon prayer; he then uttered the iqama and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted his camel and came to the place of standing, making his she-camel al-Qaswa’ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot (The Arabic is Habl al-mushat, which is variously explained as above, or as ‘the concourse of horse on foot', or as the name of a place.) in front of him. He faced the qibla and remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usama up behind him and went quickly till he came to al-Muzdalifa, where he prayed the sunset and the evening prayer with one adhan and two iqamas without saying ‘Glory be to God' between them. He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer with an adhan and an iqama when the morning light was clear. He then mounted al-Qaswa’ and when he came to the sacred site he faced the qibla, supplicated God, declared His greatness, His uniqueness and His unity, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, taking al-Fadl b. ‘Abbas behind him, and came to the valley of Muhassir (Between al-Muzdalifa and Mini). He urged the camel a little and following the middle road which comes out at the greatest jamra (Jamra, originally a pebble, is applied to a heap of stones, of which there are three in the valley of Mina. One of the rites of the hajj is to throw small stones at them), he came to the jamra which is beside the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles (Literally, 'pebbles that are thrown’: used to indicate small pebbles about the size of a date-stone), saying “God is most great” each time he threw a pebble. He threw them from the bottom of the valley, then went to the place of sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three victims with his own hand. Then he gave some to ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder, and he shared with him in his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each victim should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Then God’s messenger mounted, and going quickly to the House, prayed the noon prayer in Mecca. He came to the B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said, “Draw water, B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib. Were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you.” So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it. \n\nMuslim transmitted it."

I had raised my voice in the talbiya only for an ’umra, but the Prophet ordered me to undo my hair, comb it, raise my voice in the talbiya for the hajj, and let the ‘umra go, which I did, and performed my hajj. He sent ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu Bakr along with me and ordered me to make an ‘umra in place of the one I had missed from at-Tan‘im. She said: Those who had raised their voices in the talbiya for the ‘umra put off the ihram after making the circuit of the House and running between as-Safa and al-Marwa, then made a circuit after they returned from Mina, but those who combined the hajj and the ‘umra made only one circuit. \n\n(Bukharl and Muslim.)"

Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during the hajj and seven days when they return to their families.” He performed the circumambulation when he came to Mecca, first touching the corner (The corner of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then running during three circuits and walking during four, and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House he prayed two rak'as at the Station (Maqam Ibrahim), then giving the salutation, and departing, he went to as-Safa and went seven times between as-Safa and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his hajj, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, gone quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House, after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him.

As it was only five days before they were due at ‘Arafa, they said he had ordered them to go in to their wives and so they would come to ‘Arafa with their penises dripping with prostatic fluid. He said that Jabir made a gesture, moving his hand, and he could still imagine himself looking at him (Perhaps the gesture was meant to indicate that they could have shaken off the fluid). The Prophet then got up among them and said, “You know that I am the most godfearing, truthful and pious one among you. Were it not that I have sacrificial animals I would have removed the ihram as you are doing, and had I known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later I would not have brought sacrificial animals ; so remove the ihram.'’ They did so, hearing and obeying. ‘Ata’ quoted Jabir as saying that ‘Ali arrived after his expedition to collect the poor rate and he asked him for what he had raised his voice in the talbiya. He replied that he had done it for the same purpose as the Prophet, so God's messenger said to him, “Bring the sacrificial animals and remain in the sacred state.” He said that ‘Ali brought sacrificial animals for him and that Suraqa b. Malik b. Jush'um asked God’s messenger whether this applied to that particular year or, forever, to which he replied that it was applicable forever. \n\nMuslim transmitted it."

    "text": "Abu Bakra said that the Prophet gave them the following sermon on the day of sacrifice: “Time has completed a cycle to the form of the day when God created the heavens and the earth. The year contains twelve months of which four are sacred, three of them consecutive, viz. Dhul Qa'da, Dhul Hijja. and Muharram, and also Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha'ban.”( The month Rajab is here connected with the North Arabian tribe of Mudar because they are said to have honoured it greatly and never to have broken its sacred nature. The precise reference to its place among the months is said’to be for the purpose of removing any doubt about it owing to the earlier practice of periodically intercalating a month) He asked, “What month is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not Dhul Hijja?\" and they replied that it was. He asked, “What town is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His apostle knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not al-Balda?”( This word occurs a number of times in the Qur’an in the general sense of a district, but in 27, 91 it is used particularly of Mecca which is there called “this district (balda)\". In the tradition the word seems to be used as if it were a proper name) and they replied that it was. He asked, “What day is this?” and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not the day of sacrifice?\" and they replied that it was. He said, “Your lives, property and honour must be regarded by you with a sacredness like that of this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. O, do not revert after my death to being people who are astray, beheading one another. Have I delivered the message ?\" When they replied that he had he said, “O God, testify ; and let him who is present convey it to him who is absent, for many a one to whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than the one who hears.” \n\nBukhari and Muslim."

    "text": "Abu Shuraih al-‘Adawi told that he said to ‘Amr b. Sa‘id when he was sending troops to Mecca (The reference is to an expedition against 'Abdallah b. az-Zubair): Let me tell you something, commander, which God’s messenger said on the day following the Conquest. My ears heard it, my heart has retained it, and my eyes saw him when he spoke it. After praising and extolling God he said, “God, not men, has made Mecca sacred, so it is not allowable for a man who believes in God and in the last day to shed blood in it, or lop a tree in it. If anyone seeks licence to do so on the ground that God’s messenger fought in it, tell him that God has given permission to His messenger but not to you. He gave him permission only during one hour on one day, and its sacredness has been restored to it like what it was yesterday. Let him who is present convey the information to him who is absent.\" Abu Shuraih was asked what ‘Amr had replied, and said he had replied, “I am better informed of that than you, Abu Shuraih.' The sacred territory does not give refuge to one who is disobedient, or one who flies when he has shed blood, or one who flies because of a fault (kharba).” (The word is used of a vice) \n\nBukhari and Muslim. In Bukhari’s work kharba is said to mean a crime."

He reported God’s messenger as saying, “Medina is sacred from ‘Air to Thaur, ( This phrase has been much discussed. ‘Air is known as a hill at Medina and Thaur at Mecca. Because of the difficulty some have suggested that Uhud should be read instead of Thaur, but others feel that that is unjustifiable.) so if anyone produces an innovation in it, or gives protection to an innovator, the curse of God, the angels, and all men will rest upon him, and no repentance or ransom (Lane in his Lexicon gives a variety of meanings for this phrase, la yuqbal minhu sarf wald 'adl. The one used above seems the most suitable here) will be accepted from him. The protection granted by Muslims is one and must be respected by the humblest of them, so if anyone breaks a covenant made by a Muslim the curse of God, the angels, and all men will rest upon him and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him. If anyone gives the rights of inheritance to people without the permission of his masters, (This is explained in relation to a slave who has been set free, for the rights of inheritance still belong to his master who set him free. Cf. Book 12, ch. 6, third tradition) the curse of God, the angels, and all men will rest upon him, and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him.’’ \n\nBukhari and Muslim. A version given by both of them says, “ If anyone makes a false claim to paternity or to being a client, the curse of God, the angels and all men will rest upon him, and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him.”"
