When he said to him, \"I have nothing to give you, Jew,\" he replied, \"I will not leave you, Muhammad, till you pay me.\" God's messenger said, \"I shall sit with you, then,\" and did so. God's messenger prayed the noon, afternoon, sunset, final evening and morning prayers, and his companions were threatening and menacing the man, God's messenger being aware of what they were doing. They then said, \"Messenger of God, is a Jew keeping you in restraint!'' to which he replied, \"My Lord has prevented me from wronging one with whom a covenant has been made, or anyone else.\" Then when the day was advanced the Jew said, \"I testify that there is no god but God, I testify that you are God's messenger, and half my property will be devoted to God's path. I swear by God that my only purpose in treating you as I have done was that I might consider the description of you given in the Torah: `Muhammad b. 'Abdallah whose birthplace is in Mecca, whose place of emigration is in Taiba, and whose kingdom is in Syria; he is not harsh or rough, or loud-voiced in the streets, and he is not characterised by coarseness or lewd speech.'

    "text": "Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Bukhari said sixty-three is the commonest statement. `A'isha said: The first revelation God's messenger received was the true vision in sleep, and every vision he saw came like the bright gleam of dawn. He then became fond of solitude and would go alone to the cave on Hira where he would engage in tahannuth, which means worship for a number of nights, before feeling a yearning for his family. He would take provisions for that purpose, then he would return to Khadija and get provisions for a like period, till the truth came to him when he was in the cave on Hira. The angel came to him and said, `Recite,'[1] to which he replied, \"I am not a reciter.\" He said, \"He then took me and squeezed me till I was distressed, after which he let me go and said, `Recite.' When I replied, `I am not a reciter,' he took me and squeezed me a second time till I was distressed, then letting me go he said, `Recite;' When I replied, \"I am not a reciter,' he took me and squeezed me a third time till I was distressed. He then let me go and said, `Recite! In the name of your Lord who created, created man from a clot of blood. Recite! And your most bountiful Lord is He who taught the use of the pen, taught man what he did not know.' \"[2] \n\nGod's messenger came back with the verses, his heart trembling, and went in to Khadija and, said \"Wrap me up, wrap me up.\" So, they wrapped him up till the terror had left him. He then spoke to Khadija and informed her of what had happened, saying, \"I fear for myself.\" She replied, \"By no means! I swear by God that God will never shame you. You join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people's burdens, you give to the destitute, you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitudes which affect people's rights.\" Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal, her paternal cousin, and said to him, \"Listen, cousin, to what your nephew has to say.\" Waraqa said to him, \"Son of my brother, what do you see?'' God's messenger then informed him about what he had seen and Waraqa said, \"It is the namus[3] which God sent down to Moses. Would that I were a young man during your prophetic career! Would that I might be alive when your people expel you!\" God's messenger asked, \"Will they expel me?'' and he replied, \"Yes; no man has ever brought anything like what you have brought without meeting hostility. If I see your day, I shall give you strong help.\"Waraqa died soon afterwards, and there was an intermission in the inspiration. \n1. The word iqra means either \"recite\" or \"read\". The former is to be preferred here.\n2. Quran; 96:1-5. \n3. This word is most likely derived from the Greek nomos (law). It indicates the revelation of scripture in the form of a divine law such as that given to Moses. \"The suggestion may also have been present that Muhammad should be the founder or legislator of a community\" (W. M. Watt, Muhammad at Mecca, Oxford, 1953, p. 51).\n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) Bukhari added: so that the Prophet was grieved, as we have heard, and on that account went out in the morning several times to throw himself down from the heights of the mountain; but as often as he reached the summit of a mountain to throw himself from it, Gabriel appeared to him and said, \"Muhammad, you are truly God's messenger.\" On that account his turmoil would then quieten and he would feel at ease."

Someone went to tell Fatima who came running, and the Prophet remained in prostration till she threw it off him, faced them and reviled them. Then when God's messenger finished the prayer, he said three times, \"0 God, deal with Quraish (it being his practice when he made supplication to make it three times and when he made a request to make it three times); \n0 God, deal with 'Amr b.

He then said, \"Have you seen al-Hira, `Adi? If you live long enough you will certainly see a woman travelling from al-Hira to go round the Ka'ba, fearing no one but God; if you live long enough the treasures of Kisra will certainly be conquered; if you live long enough you will certainly see a man coming out with a handful of gold or silver looking for someone to accept it but finding no one to accept it from him.[1] One of you will certainly meet God on the day he meets Him with no one between them to interpret for him. He will then certainly say, `Did I not send you a messenger who was conveying the message to you?' He will reply, `Certainly.' He will then say, `Did I not give you property and show favour to you?' He will reply, `Certainly;' then he will look to his right and see only Jahannam, and he will look to his left and see only Jahannam. Guard against hell, even though it be with half a date;[2] and if anyone cannot get so much, he should do it with a good word.\" `Adi said: I have seen a woman travelling from al-Hira to go round the Ka'ba, fearing no one but God; I was among those who conquered the treasures of Kisra, son of Hurmuz; and if you live long enough you will see what the Prophet Abul Qasim said, one coming out with his hand full. \n Because there will be no poor at that time. \n As alms.\n\nBukhari transmitted it."

    "text": "Ibn `Abbas said Abu Sufyan b. Harb told him the following by word of mouth: During the period of peace between God's messenger and me I went off, and while I was in Syria a letter was brought from the Prophet to Hiraql. Dihya al-Kalbi brought it and handed it to the governor of Busra who handed it to Hiraql. Hiraql asked whether there was anyone there belonging to the people of that man who asserted `that he was a prophet, and when he was told that there was, I was summoned along with some members of Quraish. We entered the presence of Hiraql who made us sit in front of him and then asked, \"Which of you is most closely related to this man who asserts that he is a prophet?\" When I said that I was, they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. He then called for his interpreter and said, \"Tell them I am asking this man about this one who asserts he is a prophet, and that if he lies to me, they must accuse him of falsehood.\" (Abd Sufyan swore by God that if he had not been afraid of his falsehood being reported, he would have lied to him.) He said to his interpreter, \"Ask him about the-nature of his lineage among them,\" and I replied, \"He is a man of high lineage among us.\" He asked, \"Has there been any king among his ancestors?\" and I replied that there had not been any. He asked whether we had suspected him of falsehood before he said what he had said, and I replied that we had not. He asked whether he was followed by the nobles among the people or by the weak ones, and I replied that he was followed by the weak ones. He asked whether their numbers were increasing or diminishing, and I replied that they were increasing. He asked whether any apostatised from his religion after accepting it through displeasure with him, and I replied that they did not. He asked if we had fought with him, and I replied that we had. He asked the nature of our fighting with him, and I replied that it had its ups and downs, he neither getting the better of us nor we getting the better of him. He asked if he employed treachery, and I replied that he did not, but added that during that period we did not know what he was doing. I swear by God that he did not give me an opportunity of inserting a word except on this occasion. He asked if anyone had said what he was saying before him, and I replied that no one had. He then told his interpreter to say to me, \"I asked you about his lineage among you and you asserted that he had a high lineage among you; and messengers are commissioned thus from the high families of their people. I asked you whether any of his ancestors had been a king and you asserted that none had, for if any of his ancestors had been a king, I would have considered him to be a man who was seeking the kingdom of his ancestors. I asked you about his followers whether they were weak people or nobles, to which you replied that they were their weak ones, and such are the followers of the messengers. I asked you whether you suspected him of falsehood before he said what he has said, and you replied that you did not, so I recognised that he was not one to avoid falsehood about men and then go and lie about God. I asked you whether any of them apostatised from his religion after accepting it through displeasure with him, to which you replied that none had, and thus is faith when its cheerfulness mingles with hearts. I asked you whether they were increasing or diminishing, to which you replied that they were increasing, and thus is faith till it is complete. I asked you whether you fought with him, and you asserted that the war between you and him had its ups; and downs, he sometimes getting the better of you and you sometimes getting the better of him; now thus messengers are tested, after which the issue turns out in their favour. I asked you if he employed treachery and you asserted that he did not; now that is how the messengers are, not employing treachery. I asked you whether anyone had said what he was saying before him, and you asserted ta t no one had done so, for if someone had said this before him, I would have said he was a man who copied something said before his time.\" He then asked what he commanded us and we replied, \"He commands us to observe prayer, zakat, ties of relationship, and chastity.\" He then said, \"If what you say is true, he is a prophet. I knew he would come forth but did not think it would be from among you. If I knew I could get to him I would like to meet him, and if I were with him, I would wash his feet. His kingdom will certainly reach to what is under my feet.\" He then called for God's messenger's letter and read it. \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) The completion of the tradition has already been given in the chapter on writing to infidels."

    "text": "Qatada quoted the authority of Anas b. Malik who quoted the authority of Malik b. Sa'sa'a to the effect that God's prophet told them about the night when he was taken up to heaven, saying, \"While I was lying down at al-Hatim[2] (but perhaps he said al-Hijr), someone came to me and made a split from here to here (meaning from the pit of his chest to the hair below his navel), then took out my heart. I was next brought a gold dish full of faith, and my heart was washed, then filled up and put back. (A version says the inside was washed with Zamzam water, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom.) I was then brought a beast smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey, which was white, was called al-Buraq, and stepped a distance equal to the range of its vision. I was mounted on it, and Gabriel went with me till he came to the lowest heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Adam was there, and Gabriel said, `This is your father Adam, so give him a salutation. I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good son and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the second heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good' and the gate was opened. When I entered John[3] and Jesus, who were cousins on the mother's side, were there, and Gabriel said, `These are John and Jesus, so give them a salutation I did so, and when they had returned my salutation they said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up to the third heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him, and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome, his coming is good and the gate was opened. When I entered Joseph was there, and. Gabriel said, this is Joseph, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the fourth heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied th at th at was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Idris was there, and Gabriel said, `This is Idris, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the fifth heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Aaron was there, and Gabriel said, `This is Aaron, so give him a salutation' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the sixth heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Moses was there, and Gabriel said, `This is Moses, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Then when I passed on he wept, and when he was asked what was making him weep he replied, `I am weeping because more followers of a young man who was commissioned after my time will enter paradise than of mine.' Gabriel then took me up to the seventh heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good.' When I entered Abraham was there, and Gabriel said, `This is your father Abraham, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good son and the good prophet.' I was then taken up to the lote tree of the boundary[4] and saw that its fruits were like the earthenware vessels of Hajar and its leaves like elephants' ears. He told me that this was the lote-tree of the boundary. I saw four rivers, two concealed and two apparent, and. when I asked Gabriel what these two pairs were, he replied, `The two concealed ones are rivers in paradise, and the two apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.' After that I was shown the frequented house.[5] I was then brought a vessel of wine, a vessel of milk, and a vessel of honey, and when I took the milk he said, `It is the true religion[6] which you and your people follow.' Then fifty daily prayers were prescribed for me, but when I returned and passed Moses and on being asked by him what worship I had been commanded replied that I had been commanded to observe fifty daily prayers, he said, `Your people are not capable of observing fifty daily prayers. I swear by God that I have tested men before your time and have laboured most earnestly to prevail over the B. Isra'il, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter for your people.' I did so, and when He had reduced them by ten, I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when He had reduced them by ten, I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when He had reduced them by ten, I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when He had reduced them by ten and I had been ordered to observe ten daily prayers I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when I had been ordered to observe five daily prayers I returned to Moses. He asked what I had been ordered, and when I replied that I had been ordered to observe 'five daily prayers he said, `Your people are not capable of observing five daily prayers. I have tested men before your time and have laboured most earnestly to prevail over the B. Isra'il, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter for your people.' I replied, `I have asked my Lord till I am ashamed, but now I am satisfied and I submit.' Then when I passed on a crier called, `I have executed what I have made obligatory and have made things light for my servants'.\" \n1. Literally 'the ascent'.

I mounted it and came to Jerusalem, then tied It to the ring used by the prophets. Then after entering the mosque and praying two rak'as in it I came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said, `You have chosen the true religion.' We were then taken up to heaven ...\" and he went on with something to the same effect as has been mentioned already. He said, \"I found Adam who welcomed me and prayed for my wellbeing.\" Regarding the third heaven he said, \"I found Joseph who had been given half of beauty[*], and he welcomed me and prayed for my wellbeing.\" But he did not mention the weeping of Moses.

When what God commands overshadows it, it changes, and none of God's creatures can describe it because of its beauty. God revealed to me what He revealed and made obligatory for-me fifty prayers every day and night. I came down to Moses who asked what my Lord had made obligatory for my people, and when I told him He had prescribed fifty prayers every day and night he said, `Go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter, for your people are not capable of that. I have tested and had experience of the B. Isra'il.' I went back to my Lord and said, `0 my Lord, make things lighter for my people,' so He relieved me of five. When I returned to Moses and told him He had relieved me of five he said, `Your people are not capable of that, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter.' I then kept going back and forth between my Lord and Moses till He said, `They are five prayers every day and night, Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty times of prayer. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him, and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do it will have nothing recorded for him, and if he does it one evil deed will be recorded for him.'

He then brought a gold dish full of wisdom and faith, and after emptying it into my breast he closed it up. Then taking me by the hand he ascended with me to heaven, and when I came to the lowest heaven Gabriel said to the guardian of heaven, `Open.' He asked who was there, and when he replied that it was Gabriel, he asked whether anyone was with him. When he replied that he had Muhammad with him he was asked whether he had been sent for and replied that he had. When the gate was opened, we went up into the lowest heaven and I saw a man sitting with people on his right and people on his left. When he looked to his right he laughed, and when he looked to his left he wept. He said, `Welcome to the good prophet and the good son.' I asked Gabriel who this was and he replied, `This is Adam, and these people on his right and his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inhabitants of paradise and those on his left are the inhabitants of hell, so when he looks to his right he laughs and when he looks to his left he weeps.' He then took me up to the second heaven and said to its guardian, `Open,' and its guardian said to him the same as the first one had said.\" Anas said he mentioned that he had found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, hut did not specify the nature of their abodes, except th a t he mentioned he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth. Ibn Shihab said he was told by Ibn Hazm that Ibn `Abbas and Abu Habba al-Ansar! used to say that the Prophet said, \"I was then taken up till I mounted a height in which I heard the scraping of the pens.\" Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Prophet said, ``God then made fifty prayers obligatory for my people and I returned with that. When I passed Moses, he asked what God had made it obligatory for me to impose on my people, and when I told him He had made fifty I prayers obligatory he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your people are | not capable.'

I went back and repeated what I had said, and half of them were remitted. I then returned to him and he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your I people are not capable of that.' I went back to Him and He said, `They are five and at the same time fifty. What has been said is not changed with Me.' I then returned to Moses, and when he told me to go back to my Lord I replied, `I am ashamed to face my Lord.'

Seeing a tall, shady rock protected from the sun's rays we alighted beside it, and when I had smoothed a place with my hands for him to sleep and spread a skin garment over him, I said, \"Sleep, messenger of God, and I shall keep watch around you.\" He went to sleep, and when I went out to keep watch around him, I saw a shepherd approaching. I asked if his sheep had any milk and he replied that they had, so I asked if he would draw some milk and he agreed, and drew a cupful into a wooden cup. I had a small skin vessel I carried for the Prophet from which he took water both for drinking and for performing ablution, so I went to the Prophet, but as I did not like to waken him, I waited for him till he awoke. I then poured some water on the milk till the bottom of it was cooled, and said, \"Drink, messenger of God.\" When he had drunk an amount which made me feel pleased, he said, \"Is it not time to be moving?\" and I agreed that it was; so, we moved on after the sun had passed the meridian. Suraqa b. Malik had followed us up and I said, \"We have been overtaken, messenger of God.\" He replied, \"Do not grieve; God is with us.\" The Prophet then prayed that he might be hindered and his horse sank with him up to its belly in hard ground. He said, \"I see that you two have prayed that I might be hindered; now pray for me, for God is on your side, that I may turn away the search from you.\" The Prophet prayed for him, and when he got free, he began to say whenever he met anyone, \"You have been saved trouble, for there is no one here; and he met no one without turning him back. \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Then when God's messenger was surrounded, he dismounted from his she-mule, took a handful of earth from the ground, and turning towards them threw it in their faces saying, \"May the faces be made ugly!\" Then there was not a man among them whom God had created whose eyes were not filled with earth by reason of that handful.

He has fought valiantly in God's path and received many wounds.\" He replied, \"He will indeed be one of the inhabitants of hell.\" Some people almost doubted, but while things were so the man felt the pain of his wounds, and putting his band into his quiver drew out an arrow and stabbed himself with it. Some Muslims then hastened to God's messenger and said, \"Messenger of God, God has verified what you told. So and so has stabbed and killed himself.\" God's messenger then said, \"God is most great. I testify that I am God's servant and messenger. Get up, Bilal, and make an announcement that only a believer will enter paradise, but that God will support this religion with a wicked man[*].\"\n*While hypocrites and others whose character is worthless may fight on the side of the Muslims, only those who have faith will enter paradise. The idea is that taking part in Jihad does not of itself guarantee entrance into paradise. \n\nBukhari transmitted it."

One day when he was staying with me, he made supplication after supplication to God, then said, \"Do you know, `A'isha, that God has given me a decision about what I asked? Two men came to me and one of them sat at my head and the other at my feet. One of them asked the other, `What is the man suffering from?' and he replied, `He is under a spell.' He asked, `Who has put a spell on him?' and he replied, `Labid b. al-A`sam the Jew .' He asked, `What did he use?' and he replied, `A comb and combings and the spathe of a male palm-tree He asked, `Where is it?' and he replied, `In the well of Dharwan'[*].\" The Prophet then went with some of his companions to the well and said, \"This is the well I was shown.\" Its water looked like diluted henna and its palm-trees like the heads of devils. He then took it out. \n*Bukhari, Adab, 56, has Dharwan, but Tibb, 50, has Dhu Arwan, which is the form given by Muslim in Salam, 43. Nawawi in his commentary on Muslim (Cairo, 1349, vol. 14, p. 177) says both forms are correct, but Dhu Arwan is better and sounder. He says it was a well in the garden in Madina belonging to the B.

Tamim, came to him and said, \"Act equitably, messenger of God.\" He replied, \"Out upon you! Who will act equitably if I do not? You will be disappointed and losing if I do not act equitably.\" `Umar asked permission to cut off his head, but he replied, \"Leave him alone, for he has companions[1] in comparison with whose prayers any of you would despise his, and in comparison, with whose fasting any of you would despise his. They recite the Quran but it does not pass their collarbones. They swerve from the religion as an arrow goes through the animal aimed at. Their look is directed to its head, on to the sinew on its socket, on to its nadi, which is its rod, on to its feathers, but there is no sign of excrement or blood on it[2]. They will be recognised by the presence of a black man one of whose upper arms quivers like a woman's breast, or like a piece of meat, and they will revolt against the best section of mankind[3]. Abu Sa'id said: I testify that I heard this tradition from God's messenger, and I testify that `Ali b. Abu Talib fought with them and that I was with him. He gave orders about that man who was sought for, and when he was brought in and I looked at him, he was exactly as the Prophet had described him. A version has: A man with deep-set eyes, a projecting brow, a thick beard, high cheekbones and a shaven head came forward and said, \"Fear God, Muhammad.\" He replied, \"Who will obey God if I disobey Him? God entrusts me with power over the inhabitants of the earth but you[4] do not.\" A man asked to be allowed to kill him but he prevented him. Then when the man turned away, he said, \"From this one's stock there will be people who recite the Quran, yet it will not pass their throats. They will swerve from Islam as an arrow goes through the animal shot at. They will kill the followers of Islam and leave the worshippers of idols alone; but if I live to their time, I shall certainly kill them as `Ad were killed.\" \n1. People like him, or people at a later period who will acquire a reputation for piety. The reference is to the Kharijites. \n2. Just as an arrow can go through an animal without traces of excrement or blood, they will abandon Islam so quickly that no trace of it will be left in them. \n3. `Ali and his party. \n4.

No sooner did the people see that there was water in the ablution vessel then they crowded around it, so God's messenger said, \"Behave in an orderly manner, for every one of you will get a supply of water.\" They did so, and God's messenger began to pour and I to supply them with water till only he and I were left. He then poured and told me to drink, but I replied, \"I shall not drink till you do so, messenger of God.\" He said, \"The one who supplies water for people comes last,\" so I drank and then he drank. Then the people came to the watering-place in comfort, having had a supply of water.\n*I have retained the Arabic construction here. Abu Qatada is telling the story and elsewhere uses the first-person pronoun when making reference to himself,\n\nMuslim transmitted it thus in his Sahih, and it is told similarly in al-Humaidi's book and in Jami' al-usul. In al-Masabih the words \"in drinking\" are added after \"comes last.\""

When she had prepared it in a cooking-pot she said, \"Take this to God's messenger, Anas, say your mother has sent this to him along with her good wishes, and tell him this is a small gift to him from us.\" When I had gone and repeated this, he told me to put it down, then said, \"Go and invite so and so, so and so, and so and so (naming some men) to come to me, and invite those whom you meet to come to me.\" I invited those he named and those I met, and when I returned the house was crowded with people[2]. (Anas was asked how many there were and replied that there were about three hundred.) I saw the Prophet put his hand on that bit of hais and say such words as God wished. He then began to invite them to eat in groups of ten, and he was saying to them, \"Mention God's name, and let each man eat from the place nearest him.\" When they had eaten to their satisfaction one party went out and another entered till they had all eaten. He told me to remove the food and I did so, and I do not know whether there was more of it when I set it down or when I removed it. \n Hais (special dish prepared from dried yoghourt, butter and dates).\n This is what the Arabic says, but in view of what follows about the people being admitted in tens, it probably means that the house was surrounded by a great throng.\n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

While we were travelling with him, we passed a camel being used for irrigation, and when the camel saw him, it rumbled and bent down its neck. The Prophet stopped beside it and asked where the owner of that camel was, and when he came, he asked him to sell it to him. He replied, \"No, I shall not give it to you, messenger of God, it belongs to a family which has no other means of livelihood.\" He said, \"Since you have mentioned this about it, note that it has complained to me of a great amount of work and a small amount of fodder; so, treat it well[*].\" We then travelled on, and when we came to a stage and the Prophet had lain down to sleep a tree came cleaving the earth till it overshadowed him and then returned to its place. When God's messenger awoke, I mentioned the m atter to him and he said, \"It is a tree which asked its Lord's permission to give a salutation to God's messenger, and He allowed it.\" We then travelled on, and when we passed a watering-place a woman brought a son of hers who was possessed, and the Prophet seized his nostril and said, \"Come out, for I am Muhammad, God's messenger.\" We then travelled on, and when we passed that watering-place on the way back he asked the woman about the boy and she said, \"I swear by Him who commissioned you with the truth that we have seen nothing in him to disturb us since you left.\" \n*The Prophet evidently had no desire to take the camel either by payment or as a gift, since it was the man's only means of earning a livelihood. He therefore left him with an exhortation to treat the camel properly.\n\nIt is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna."

    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas said: \"One night, Quraish consulted together in Mecca. Some said they should tie him up (i.e., the Prophet) in the morning; others said they should rather kill him; and others said they should rather expel him. God informed His prophet about that, so `Ali spent that night on the Prophet's bed, and the Prophet went out till he came to the cave. The polytheists spent the night keeping guard on `Ali, thinking he was the Prophet, and in the morning, they rushed on him, but when they saw `Ali, God had turned away their guile. They asked, \"Where is this companion of yours?\" and he replied, \"I do not know.\" They tracked him but when they reached the mountain his tracks became confused, so they went up the mountain and passed by the cave. They saw a spider's web at the entrance and said, \"If he had entered here there would not have been a spider's web at the entrance.\" He stayed in it for three nights. \n\nAhmad transmitted it."

Fuhaira, Abu Bakr's client, with `Abdallah al-Laithi as their guide. They passed the two tents of Umm Ma'bad and asked her for some meat and dates meaning to buy them from her, but found she had nothing of that nature, for the provisions were exhausted as the tribe had been afflicted with famine. God's messenger looked at a sheep at the side of the tent and said, \"What is this sheep, Umm Ma'bad?\" She replied, \"It is a sheep too emaciated to follow the flock.\" He asked if it had any milk, and when she replied that it was too exhausted for that, he asked if she would let him milk it. She said, \"You for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom, if you see anything to milk in it, milk it.\" God's messenger asked it to be brought, and wiping its udder with his hand and mentioning the name of God most high, he prayed that she might have a blessing in her sheep. It then opened its legs for him, gave a flow of milk and ruminated. He called for a vessel which could hold enough for the people and milked an abundant supply into it till the froth appeared on the top. He gave her a drink till she was satisfied and gave his companions a drink till they were satisfied, then drank himself last of all. Immediately afterwards he milked it a second time, and when he had filled the vessel, he left it with her. He contracted with her [to accept Islam] and they departed from her. \n\nIt is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna, by Ibn `Abd al-Barr in al-Isti'ab, and by Ibn al-Jauzi Kitab al-wafa'.

Whenever they raised a morsel to their mouths the place from which it was taken increased in quantity, so Abu Bakr said to his wife, \"You who come from the B.

These two were sent to Medina before the Hijra to teach the people who had sworn allegiance to the Prophet. \n2. 'Ammar b. Yasir. \n3. Bilal b. Rabah. \n4. Sa'd b. Abu Waqqe. \n5.

In the version of Sulaiman b. Abu Muslim al-Ahwal Ibn `Abbassaid, \"Thursday, what a Thursday!'' and then wept till his tears wet the pebbles. Ibn `Abbas was asked what about Thursday and replied, \"God's messenger's pain became severe and he said, 'If you bring me a shoulderblade I shall write you a document after which you will never go astray.' They quarrelled, a thing most unfitting in a prophet's presence, asked what was the matter with him, whether he was delirious, and said they should ask him for an explanation. They then kept at him, so he said, `Leave me alone and let me be, for what I am engaged in is better than what you are summoning me to.' He then gave them three commands. He told them to expel the polytheists from Arabia and to reward deputations as he had been accustomed to do, but he either did not mention the third, or he did so and I have forgotten it.\" Sufyan said this is from what Sulaiman said. \n1.

He asked permission to enter, and when the Prophet asked about him Gabriel replied, \"This is the angel of death who is asking permission to come in to you, a thing he has never done to any human being before you and will never do to any human being after you.\" He told him to let him come in, and when that was done, he gave him a salutation and said, \"God has sent me to you, Muhammad, and if you order me to take your spirit I shall do so, but if you order me to leave it alone I shall do so.\" He asked, \"Will you do that, angel of death?\" and he replied, \"Yes, that is what I have been commanded, and I have been commanded to obey you.\" God's messenger then looked at Gabriel and Gabriel said, \"God has longed to meet you, Muhammad,\" so the Prophet said to the angel-of death, \"Go on with what you have been commanded,\" and he took his spirit.
