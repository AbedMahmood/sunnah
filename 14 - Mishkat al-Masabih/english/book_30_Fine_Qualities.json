Quraish and others began to go past him, and when `Abdallah b. `Umar came past he stopped where he was and said, \"Peace be upon you, Abu Khubaib; peace be upon you, Abu Khubaib; peace be upon you, Abu Khubaib! I swear by God that I was forbidding you to do what would lead to this. I swear by God that I was forbidding you to do what would lead to this. I swear by God that I was forbidding you to do what would lead to this. I swear by God that I have known you were given to fasting, praying by night and joining ties of relationship. I swear by God that a people among whom you are reckoned the worst is a wicked people[2].\" A version has, ``a good people\". `Abdallah b. `Umar then moved on. When al-Hajjaj heard of 'Abdallah stopping and of what he had said, he sent and had Ibn az-Zubair taken down from his palm-trunk and cast among the graves of the Jews. He then sent for his mother, Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr, but she refused to go to him. He then sent the messenger back to say she must come, or he would send someone for her who would drag her by the hair. She refused to go saying, \"I swear by God that I shall not go to you till you send someone for me to drag me by my hair.\" He called for his smooth leather sandals, and taking them went off in a hurry[3]. Then when he went in to see her, he said, \"What do you think of the way I have dealt with God's enemy?\" She replied, \"I consider that you have spoiled his worldly interests and that he has spoiled your interests in the next world. I heard that you were addressing him as the son of the woman with two girdles. I swear by God that I am the woman with two girdles, one of which was used by me to tie up the food of God's messenger and of Abu Bakr out of reach of animals, and the other is the girdle with which no woman can dispense. God's messenger told us that Thaqif would have among them a great liar and one who would cause destruction, and I consider that the one who was to cause destruction is no other than you.\" He then got up and left her, and said no more to her. \n1. The reference is to Abdallah's dead body where he was crucified on the outskirts of Mecca. \n2. Mirqat, 5:515, explains this as meaning that a people who think such a good man to be the worst of them are indeed wicked. The version which follows gives a twist to the meaning, suggesting that a people among whom he is the worst must be very good. \n3. Or, swaggering.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."

God's messenger then spat and the pain left him, but the effect of the poison later returned and was the cause of his death.

One suggestion is that shabab (plural of shabb) which means \"youths\" is used in the same sense as fatan (young man) when it means a brave warrior without any particular indication of age. A less likely suggestion is that the words refer to all those who go to paradise, apart from prophets and the four rightly-guided Caliphs, because all the inhabitants of paradise will be young. Another suggestion is that the words refer to those who were young when the Prophet spoke them.\n\nTirmidhi transmitted it."

It is not so.

It was addressed from Hatib b. Abu Balta'a, to some of the polytheists in Mecca giving them some information about God's messenger. He asked, \"What is this, Hatib?\" and he replied, \"Messenger of God, do not be hasty with me. I have been a man attached as an ally to Quraish and not one of themselves, while those of the Emigrants who are with you have relationship to them by which they guard their property and family in Mecca. As I did not have that advantage by being of their stock, I wanted to give them some help for which they might guard my relations. I am not guilty of unbelief or apostasy from my religion, or of pleasure in infidelity after accepting Islam.\" God's messenger said, \"He has told you the truth,\" and `Umar said, \"Messenger of God, let me cut off this hypocrite's head.\" But God's messenger replied, \"He was present at Badr, and how do you know [he deserves this]? Perhaps God has looked with pity on those who were present at Badr and said, `Do what you wish,1 for paradise is guaranteed to you.'\" A version has \"You have been forgiven.\" God most high then sent down, \"You who believe, do not take my enemies and yours as friends[2].\"\n This place was on the way from Medina to Mecca, presumably nearer Medina than Mecca.\n Mirqat, 5:630, says this refers to a small or large amount of good deeds and supererogatory acts.

    "text": "Shuraih b. `Ubaid told that when the people of Syria were mentioned in `Ali's presence and someone said, \"Curse them, commander of the faithful,\" he refused, saying he had heard God's messenger say, \"The substitutes[*], a body of forty men, will be in Syria, and as often as one dies God will put another in his place. By virtue of them rain will be provided, by virtue of them help will be sought against enemies, and by virtue of them affliction will be averted from the Syrians.\" One of the Companions reported God's messenger as saying, \"Syria will be conquered, and when you are given your choice of places in which to settle go on a city called Damascus, for it will be the fortress of the Muslims to protect them in the wars during which it will be a place of assembly. In its neighbourhood there is some land called al-Ghuta.\" \n*al-abdal. These belong to one of the degrees of the Sufi hierarchy of saints. There are different views as to their number. This tradition would seem to support the view which holds that there are 70. forty in Syria and thirty elsewhere. They presumably get their title because every vacancy in their number is immediately filled.\n\nAhmad transmitted the two traditions."

A comparison between you and the Jews and Christians is like a man who employed labourers and said, `Who will work for me till midday for a qirat each?' The Jews worked till midday for a qirat each, and then he said, `Who will work for me from midday till the afternoon prayer for a qirat each?' The Christians worked from midday till the afternoon prayer for a qirat each, and then he said, `Who will work for me from the afternoon prayer till sunset for two qirat each?' I assure you that you are the ones who work from the afternoon prayer till sunset and that you will have the reward twice over. The Jews and Christians were angry and said, `We have done more work and received less pay,' but God most high asked, `Have I wronged you in any respect regarding what was due to you?' When they admitted that He had not, God most high said, `It is my extra favour which I grant to whomsoever I will.'\" \n\nBukhari transmitted it."
