    "text": "Abu Malik al-Ash‘ari reported God’s messenger as saying, “Being purified is half of faith, saying ‘Praise be to God’ fills the scale, saying ‘Glory be to God’ and ‘Praise be to God' fill or fills* the space between the heavens and the earth, prayer is a light, sadaqa is a proof [of sincere faith], endurance is a shining glory, and the Qur’an is a proof on your behalf or against you. All men go out early and sell themselves, thereby setting themselves free or destroying themselves.”\n*An alternative reading is given in the text, the first feminine dual and the second feminine singular.\n\nMuslim transmitted it. A version has, “Saying ‘There is no god but God’ and ‘God is most great’ fills the space between heaven and earth.” I did not find this version in the two Sahihs, in al-Humaidi's book [Al-jam' bain as-sahihain], or in the Jami [ibn al-Athir’s Jami' al-usul] but Darimi mentioned it in place of “Glory be to God and Praise be to God.”"

Zaid b. ‘Asim, on being asked how God’s messenger used to perform ablution, called for ablution water and poured it over his hands, washing each hand twice. He then rinsed his mouth and cleared his nose with water three times. He then washed his face three times, then washed each arm twice up to the elbows, then wiped his head both front and back with his hands, beginning with the front of the head and moving them to the nape of the neck, then bringing them back to the place from which he began. He then washed his feet. Malik and Nasa’i transmitted it, and Abu Dawud has something similar. The author of the Jami‘ mentioned it. In the version of Bukhari and Muslim ‘Abdallah b. Zaid b. ‘Asim was asked to perform ablution for them as God's messenger had done, so he called for a vessel and, pouring water from it on his hands, he washed them three times, then inserted his hand and brought it out, rinsed his mouth and snuffed up water from the palm of one hand, doing that three times. He then inserted his hand and brought it out and washed his face three times, then inserted his hand and brought it out and washed each arm up to the elbows twice, then inserted his hand and brought it out and wiped his head both front and back with his hands. He then washed his feet up to the ankles and said, “This is how God’s messenger performed ablution.” A version says that he moved them to the front and the back beginning with the front of his head, then moving them to the nape of his neck, then bringing them back till he reached the place from which he had begun, after which he washed his feet. Another version says that he rinsed his mouth, snuffed up water and cleared his nose three times with three handfuls of water. Another version says that he rinsed his mouth and snuffed up water from one palm, doing that three times. In a version by Bukhari he wiped his head front and back with both hands once, then washed his feet up to the ankles. In another by him he rinsed his mouth and cleared his nose with water three times from one handful."

After doing so, in the course of his talk that day he said that a man going along a street met God’s messenger when he came out of the privy, or had passed water, and saluted him without receiving any response. Then when the man was almost going out of sight in the street God’s messenger struck his hands on a wall, wiped his face with them, struck once more and wiped his forearms, then responded to the man’s salutation, saying, “The only thing which prevented me from responding to your salutation was that I was not in a state of purity.”\n\nAbu Dawud transmitted it."

He replied that, while not obligatory, it had a more cleansing effect and was better for the one who observed it; but if anyone did not bathe there was no obligation for him to do so. He then said that he would tell them how the practice of bathing on Friday began. The people were in difficult circumstances, their clothing being of wool and their work being the carrying of loads on their backs. Their mosques was rather small and had a low roof which was only made of trellis work. God’s messenger came out one hot day when the people were sweating in their woollen garments to such an extent that they annoyed one another by the odours which were spread around. When God’s messenger noticed those odours he said, “When this day comes, you people must wash, and each of you should apply the best grease and perfume you can find.” Ibn ‘Abbas added that when God afterwards brought prosperity, they wore clothes not made of wool, they did not need to do manual labour, their mosque was extended, and some of the annoyance caused to one another by the sweat came to an end. \n\nAbu Dawud transmitted it."

Hudair and ‘Abbad b. Bishr came and said, ‘Messenger of God, the Jews are saying such and such. Shall we not then live with them?”* The face of God’s messenger underwent such a change that we thought he was angry with them; but when they went out they were met by a gift of milk which was being brought to the Prophet, and he sent after them and gave them a drink, whereby they knew that he was not angry with them. \n*i.e. with our wives. The word used in this tradition ordinarily refers to sexual intercourse, but it would seem that here and in the first sentence it rather expresses the idea being beside their wives during their periods.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."
