In the morning the man accepted Islam and God’s messenger ordered a sheep to be milked for him . When he had drunk what was drawn from it he ordered another to be milked, but when he did not finish all the milk God’s messenger said, “ The believer drinks in one intestine, but the infidel drinks in seven.”"

Bilal then came to tell him the time for prayer had come, and he threw down the knife saying, “What is the m atter with him! May his hands be covered with dust!”* My moustache was long, so he said, “I shall clip it for you over a tooth-stick,” or, “Clip it over a tooth-stick.”\n*Taribat yadahu. I have here translated the phrase literally, but cf. p. 658. It is not normally to be taken literally. In this tradition the Prophet is evidently displeased because the call to prayer has been made so soon, but it should not be understood that he is calling down a curse on Bilal. In its use here it may indicate some degree of displeasure, but nothing more.\n\nTirmidhi transmitted it*"

If all one can do is to put a piece of wood over his vessel and mention God's name let him do so, for a mouse sets a house on fire over its inhabitants.” In a version by him he said, “Do not let your animals and children go at large when the sun sets till the first and darkest part of the night has passed, for the devil is sent out; from the time the sun sets till the first and darkest part of the night is past.” In a version by him he said, “Cover the vessel and tie up the water-skin, for there is a night in the year when pestilence descends, and it does not pass an uncovered vessel or an untied water-skin without some of that pesti- lence descending into it.”"
