I shall then say, `0 my Lord, grant me permission regard - ing those who have said there is no god but God,' and He will reply, `You have no business with this, but by my might, glory, pride and greatness, I will certainly bring out of it those who have said there is no god but God'.\" \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

    "text": "Abu Sa'id al-Khudri told that when some people asked God's messenger whether they would see their Lord on the day of resurrection he replied, \"Yes. Do you disagree about seeing the sun at noonday when it is unconcealed and there are no clouds, or do you disagree about seeing the moon on the night when it is full when it is unconcealed and there are no clouds?\" On their replying that they did not, he said, \"You will not disagree about the vision of God on the day of resurrection any more than you do about seeing one of them. When the day of resurrection comes a mu'adhdhinwill cry, `Let every people follow what it was worshipping.' Then all who worshipped idols and stones apart from God will fall one after the other into hell, and when only the righteous and wicked who worshipped God are left the Lord of the universe will come to them and say, `What are you waiting for? Let every people follow what it was worshipping.' They will reply, `Our Lord, we kept separate from the people in the world though we felt great need of them, and did not associate with them.' (In Abu Huraira's version they will say, `This is our place till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us we shall recognize Him.') In Abu Sa'id's version He will say, `Is there a sign between you and Him by which you will recognize Him? On their replying that there is, things will be made plain[1]. Those who prostrated themselves before God for His sake will all be permitted by God to prostrate themselves, but those who prostrated themselves for self-protection and show will all have their backs made into one piece by God and will fall on the back of their necks as often as they wish to prostrate themselves. The bridge will then he set up over Jahannam and intercession will be allowed, and they[2] will say, `O God, keep safe, keep safe.' The believers will then pass over like the twinkling of an eye, like lightning, like wind, like a bird, like the finest horses and camels. Some will escape and be kept safe, some will be lacerated and let go, and some will be pushed into the fire of Jahannam. Then when the believers are safe from hell, I swear by Him in whose hand my soul is that none of you is more eager to claim a right when it has become clear to you than those who believe in God will be on the day of resurrection to make claims on behalf of their brethren who are in hell. They will say, `0 our Lord, they were fasting along with us, praying and performing pilgrimage, and will be told to bring out those they recognize. Their faces will be protected from the fire and they will bring forth a large number of people, then say, `O our Lord, not one of those about whom Thou didst give us command remains in it.' He will reply, `Go back and bring forth those in whose hearts you find as much as a dinar of good.' When they have brought forth a large number of people He will say, `Go back and bring forth those in whose hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good.' When they have brought forth a large number of people He will say, 'Go back and bring forth those in whose hearts you find as much as an atom of good.' When they have brought forth a large number of people they will say, `O our Lord, we have not left in it any good.' Then God will say, 'The angels have interceded, the prophets have interceded, the believers have interceded, and only the Most Merciful of the merciful ones remains.' He will then take a handful from hell, bring forth from it people who never did any good, who have been turned into charcoal and cast them into a river at the outskirts of paradise called the river of life. They will come out as a seed comes out from the rubbish carried away by a flood, and they will come forth like pearls with seals on their necks. The inhabitants of paradise will say, `Those are they who have been set free by the Compassionate One who has brought them into paradise without anything they have done or any good they have sent before them.' They will then be told that theirs is what they see and a like quantity along with it.\" \n Quran, 48:42 The reference is either to the beginning of terrors, or to the end of all mystery. The second of the two meanings given seems to fit this passage.\n Presumably the Prophets, but later in this tradition reference is made to intercession having been made by angels, prophets and believers. Abu Huraira's tradition however states that the messenger will say these words.\n \n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

    "text": "Abu Huraira told that the people asked, \"Messenger of God, shall we see our Lord on the day of resurrection?\" and then mentioned something to the same general effect as Abu Sa'id's tradition, except for \"things will be made plain[1].\" The Prophet then said, \"The Path will be set over the main part of jahannam and I shall be the first of the messengers to take his people across. On that day only the messengers will speak and what they say that day will be, `0 God, keep safe, keep safe.' In jahannam there will be pronged flesh-hooks like sadan[2] thorns whose size is known only to God, and they will seize people for their deeds, some being confined for what they have done and others being cut in small pieces and escaping. Then when God finishes judging His servants and desires to take out of hell such people as He pleases among those who testified that there is no god but God, He will command the angels to bring out those who worshipped God. They will do so, recognising them by the marks of prostration, God most high having prevented hell from devouring the mark of prostration, for hell will devour everything in the sons of Adam except the mark of prostration. They will come forth from hell having been burned, the water of life will be poured over them, and they will sprout as a seed does in the rubbish carried away by a flood. Bat a man who will be the last of the inhabitants of hell to enter paradise will remain between paradise and hell facing hell and will say, `0 my Lord, turn my face away from hell, for its odour has annoyed me and its fierce blaze has burned me; but God will reply, 'If I do that you will perhaps ask something else.' He will say, `No, by Thy might,' giving God such covenant and agreement as God wishes, and He will turn his face away from hell. When he is turned to face paradise and sees its beauty, he will remain silent as long as God wishes him to remain so, and will then say, 'O my Lord, bring me forward to the gate of paradise.' God who is blessed and exalted will reply, `Did you not give covenants and agreement that you would not ask anything beside what you have asked?' and he will say, `O my Lord, let me not be made the most miserable of Thy creatures.' He will ask, `What else are you likely to ask for if you are granted that?' and he will reply, `No, by Thy might, I shall ask nothing else.' He will then give his Lord such covenant and agreement as He wishes, and He will bring him forward to the gate of paradise. Then when he reaches its gate and sees its freshness and the splendour and joy it contains, he will remain silent as long as God wishes him to remain so, and will then say, `O my Lord, bring me into paradise.' God who is blessed and exalted will reply, `Woe to you, son of Adam, how treacherous you are! Have you not given covenants and agreement that you would not ask anything more than you have been granted?' and he will say, `O my Lord, do not make me the most miserable of Thy creatures.' He will continue making supplication till God laughs at him, and when He does so He will give him permission to enter paradise, and will say, `State your wish.' When he has done so till his wishing has come to an end God most high will say, `State your wish from such and such,' his Lord mentioning the matters to him. Then when there is nothing more he can wish God will say, `You can have that and a similar amount along with it'.\" In Abu Sa'id's version God says, \"You can have that and ten times as much.\" \n i.e., they will have everything as far as their eyes can see. \n The name of a plant with a prickly head on which camels pasture.\n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

His attention will then be drawn to a tree and he will say, `O my Lord, bring me near this tree so that I may shelter in its shade and drink some of its water.' God will reply, `Son of Adam, if I grant you that you will perhaps ask me for something else,' and he will say, `No, my Lord' and make a covenant with Him not to ask Him for anything else. His Lord will excuse him because he is seeing something he cannot help desiring, so He will bring him near it and he will shelter in its shade and drink some of its water. His attention will then be drawn to a tree more beautiful than the first and he will say, `O my Lord, bring me near this tree in order that I may drink some of its water and shelter in its shade. I shall not ask Thee for anything else.' He will reply, `Son of Adam, did you not covenant with me not to ask anything else?' and He will add, `If I bring you near it you will perhaps ask me for something else.'

He will reply, `Son of Adam, did you not covenant with me not to ask me for anything else?' and he will say, `Certainly, my Lord, but I shall not ask Thee for anything else than this.' So his Lord will excuse him because he is seeing something he cannot help desiring and will bring him near it; but when He does so he will hear the voices of the inhabitants of paradise and say, `0 my Lord, bring me into it.' He will reply, `Son of Adam, what will bring an end to your making requests of me? Will it please you if I give you the world and a like amount along with it?' He will `say, '0 my Lord, art Thou mocking me when Thou art the Lord of the universe?'\" Ibn Mas'ud then laughed and asked his hearers why they did not ask him what he was laughing at. On their doing so he told them that God's messenger had laughed similarly, and when he was asked what he was laughing at he said, \"At the Lord of the universe laughing when he said, `Art Thou mocking me when Thou art the Lord of the universe?' He will reply, `I am not mocking you, but I have power to do whatever I will'.\" \n\nMuslim transmitted it."

They will then be granted permission for the period of a Friday in this world and will visit their Lord whose throne will be shown to them, and He will appear to them in one of the gardens of paradise. Pulpits of light, pulpits of pearls, pulpits of rubies, pulpits of chrysoprase, pulpits of gold and pulpits of silver will be placed for them, and the humblest of them, for there is no one worthless among them, will sit on mounds of musk and camphor, not considering that those who are on the chairs are in a more excellent position than they. Abu Huraira told that he asked, \"Messenger of God, shall we see our Lord?\" to which he replied, \"Yes, are you in doubt about seeing the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?\" On receiving the reply that they were not, he said, \"Similarly you will have no doubts about the vision of your Lord, and no man will remain in that assembly without God conversing with him, till he says to one of them, `So and so son of so and so, do you remember the day you said such and such?' and He will remind him of one of the dishonest things he did in the world. He will say, `0 my Lord, hast Thou not forgiven me?' and He will reply, `Yes; by the wideness of my forgiveness, you have reached this station of yours.' While that is taking place a cloud will overshadow them from above and rain on them perfume whose fragrance will be such as they have never experienced my thing to compare with, and our Lord will say, `Get up and go to the honour I have prepared for you, and take what you desire.' We shall then come to a market surrounded by angels containing such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard, and hearts have never thought of. What we desire will be conveyed to us, there being no buying or selling in it, and in that market the inhabitants of paradise will meet one another. A man of exalted station will come forward and meet one who is humbler than he, though there is no one worthless among them, who will be charmed by the clothing he sees him wearing, but before their talk comes to an end, he will imagine that he has something more beautiful than the other. That is because it is not fitting for anyone to grieve in it. We shall then go to our dwellings and our wives will meet us and say, `Welcome; you have come with more excellent beauty than you had when you left us.' We shall reply, To-day we have had a meeting with our Lord, the Overpowering One, and it is fitting that we should come away as we have done'.\" \n\nTirmidhi and Ibn Majah trans - mitted it, Tirmidhi saying this is a gharib tradition"

They will cry for help and will be helped with food of dari' [1] which neither fattens nor satisfies hunger. They will then call for food and will be fed with food which chokes[2]. So, remembering that they helped down choking food with drink when they were in the world they will ask for drink and the scalding drink[3] will be presented to them on iron flesh-hooks. When they approach their faces they will scorch their faces, and when they enter their bellies, they will cut in pieces the contents of their bellies. They will then ask the guards of Jahannam to be called and they will say, `Did your messengers not bring you the clear signs?' and when they reply, `Yes,' they will say, `Then make supplication, but the supplication of the infidels is only in error[4].' They will then ask Malik to be called and will say, `0 Malik, would that your Lord might put an end to us!' He will reply to them, `You are remaining'[5] (al-A`mash[6] saying he had been informed that the period between their appeal and Malik's reply to them would be a thousand years). They will then say, `Call your Lord, for no one is better than your Lord,' and they will say, `0 our Lord, our adversity was too much for us and we were a people who were astray. 0 our Lord, bring us out of it; then if we return to evil, we shall indeed be wrongdoers.'

One day when he and Sarah came by a tyrant who was told that there was a man present accompanied by a most beautiful woman, he sent for him and asked him who she was, to which he replied that she was his sister. He then went to Sarah and told her that if this tyrant knew she was his wife he would take her away from him, so if he asked her, she must inform him she was his sister[3], she being his sister in Islam, for he and she were the only believers on the face of the earth. She was sent for arid brought to him and Abraham stood up and prayed. When she entered his presence, he was about to touch her with his hand, but he had a seizure (a variant saying that he choked) and kicked the ground with his feet. He asked her to supplicate God for him, saying he would do her no harm, and she did so; but when he was set free, he stretched out to touch her a second time and suffered a similar or a more severe seizure. He asked her to supplicate God for him, saying he would do her no harm, and she did so. He then called one of his chamberlains, and saying that it was not a human being but a devil he had brought him, he told him to give her Hagar as a servant. She came to Abraham while he was standing in prayer, and he made a sign with his hand indicating that he was asking what had happened. She told him that God had thrown back the infidel's scheme in his throat and given Hagar as a servant.\" Abu Huraira said, \"That was your mother, B. Ma' as-Sama'.'?[4] \n Quran, 37: 89. \n Quran, 21: 63. \n Cf. Genesis, 12:11 ff. \n This is said to be a general term for the Arabs because they sought out places where rain fell. \nMa' as-sama' means literally \"the water of the sky.\" Ma' as-sama' was a laqab of Mawiya, mother of al-Mundhir III, king of al-Hira, but it is difficult to see how that has any connection here. Ma' as sama' is also said to be applied to Zamzam, which is traditionally said to be the well which the angel revealed to Hagar and her son Ishmael. That might justify the suggestion that Abu Huraira is here referring to the northern Arabs in particular.\n \n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Isra'il annoyed him by saying that he concealed himself to this extent only because of some skin trouble such as leprosy or a scrotal hernia, but God wished to clear him. So, one day when he was alone having a bath, he placed his garment on a stone and the stone flew away with his garment. Moses raced after it saying, `My garment, stone; my garment, stone,' till he came to a company of the B. Isra'il who, seeing him naked in the most beautiful form God had created, said, `We swear by God that there is nothing wrong with Moses.' He took his garment and began to beat the stone, and I swear by God that there were three, four, or five scars on the stone from the effect of his beating.\" \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

    "text": "He told that while God's prophet and his companions were sitting clouds came over them and God's prophet asked, \"Do you know what these are?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"These are the clouds (`anan), these are the water-carriers of the earth which God drives to people who do not thank Him or call upon Him.\" He then asked, \"Do you know what is above you?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"It is the firmament, a ceiling which is guarded and waves which are kept back.\" He then asked, \"Do you know what is between you and it?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"Between you and it are five hundred years.\" He then asked, \"Do you knew what is above that?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"Two heavens with a distance of five hundred years between them.\" He went on speaking like that till he counted seven heavens, the distance between each pair being like that between the heaven and the earth. He then asked, \"Do you know what is above that?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"Above that is the Throne, and the distance between it and the [seventh] heaven is the same as that between each pair of heavens.\" He then asked, \"Do you know what is below you?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"It is the earth.\" He then asked, \"Do you know what is under that?\" On their replying that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"Under it there is another earth with a journey of five hundred years between them,\" and so on till he had counted seven earths with a journey of five hundred years between each pair. He then said, \"By Him in whose hand Muhammad's soul is, if you were to drop a rope[1] to the lowest earth it would not pass out of God's knowledge[2].\" He then recited, \"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward, and He is omniscient[3].\" Ahmad and Tirmidhi transmitted it, Tirmidhi saying[4] that God's messenger's recitation of the verse indicates that it would go down within God's knowledge, power and authority, for God's knowledge, power and authority are everywhere, while He is on the Throne, as He described Himself in His Book[5].\n This is the reading in the text on the margin of Mirqat. In Tirmidhi, in his book on Tafsir al Quran, the tradition occurs in his section on sura 57 (al-hadid), the reading being \"if you were to drop a man with a rope...\"\n Literally, \"it would fall upon God.\" \n Quran, 57:3.\n Tirmidhi says in the passage cited above, \"some of the learned have expounded this tradition...\"\n Cf. Quran; 7:54; 10:3, etc."
