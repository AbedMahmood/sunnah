    "text": "Ya’ la b. Umayya said: I went with God’s Messenger on the expedition of the army of distress,* and I had a hired servant who fought with a man, one of whom bit the other’s hand. The one who was bitten drew away his hand from the mouth of the one who bit him, dislodging his front tooth which fell out. He went to the Prophet, but he imposed no retaliation for his front tooth, saying, ‘Could he be expected to leave his hand in your mouth when you were crunching it like a male camel?” \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)\n\n* This refers to the expedition to Tabuk in 9 A H.

God’s Messenger then said, “It is not lawful for a Muslim to frighten another.” \n\nAbu Dawud transmitted it.\n\n* The meaning is that he tied the rope round him while he was asleep, presumably as a joke."

Meeting Abu Barza al-Aslami along with some of his companions on a festival day, I asked him whether he had heard God’s Messenger mentioning the Kharijites, and he replied that he had both heard him with his ears and seen him with his eyes. He told that God’s Messenger was brought some property and divided it, giving something to those on his right and those on his left, but giving nothing to those who were behind him. One of those behind him, a black man whose hair was completely cut off and who was wearing two white garments, then said, \"You have not divided justly, Muhammad.” God's Messenger became very angry and said, “I swear by God that after my death you will not find a man more just than I am,” adding, “At the end of time people looking like this man will come forth, reciting the Qur'an, but it will not pass their throats. They will swerve from Islam as an arrow passes through the game at which is it shot, and their distinguishing mark will be shaving. They will continue to come forth till the last of them comes forth with the antichrist. When you meet them they will be the worst of men and beasts.” \n\nNasa’i transmitted it."
