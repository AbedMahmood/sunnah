He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night, and he prayed as much as he could while God’s Messenger and his companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned on his camel facing in the direction from which the dawn should appear; but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning on his camel, and neither God’s Messenger nor Bilal awoke, nor did any of his companions till the sun shone on them. God's Messenger was the first of them to awake, and being startled he called to Bilal, who said \"He who took away my soul is the One who took away yours.\"2 He said, \"Lead the beasts on,” and when they had done so for some distance, God’s Messenger performed ablution, gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the iqama, and then led them in the Morning Prayer. When he finished the prayer he said, \"If anyone forgets prayer he should say it when he remembers it, for God has said, ‘And observe the prayer for remembrance of me.’”3\n\n 1. In 7 AH.\n 2. This is probably to be connected with the thought in the Qur’an, 39:42, which speaks of God taking the souls of people during their sleep.\n 3. Al-Qur’an; 20:14\n\nMuslim transmitted it."

The people were startled when they awoke, and God’s Messenger ordered them to mount and get out of that wadi, saying, \"This is a wadi inhabited by a devil.” So they mounted, and when they had gone out of that wadi God’s Messenger ordered them to dismount and perform ablution, and having ordered Bilal to summon the people to prayer, or pronounce the iqama, he led the people in prayer and afterwards departed. He had noticed some of their dismay, so he said, \"You people must realise that God took our spirits, and if He had wished He would have returned them to us at another time than this; so if anyone of you sleeps beyond the time for prayer, or forgets it, then has recourse to it, he should observe it as he has been in the habit of doing at its proper time.” God’s Messenger then turned to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, “The devil came to Bilal while he was standing engaged in prayer, and making him lie down, he kept soothing him as a child is soothed till he fell asleep.” He then summoned Bilal who told him something similar to what he had just told Abu Bakr, whereupon Abu Bakr said. “I testify that you are God’s Messenger.” \n\nMalik transmitted it in mursal form."

He then came cut quickly, and when the iqama had been uttered he conducted the prayer in a shortened form; then when he had given the salutation he called out to us saying, “Keep to your rows as you were.” Then turning to us he said, “I shall tell you what detained me from you this morning. I got up during the night, performed ablution, and prayed what I could; but during my prayer I dozed and was overcome, and there and then I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form. He addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ and I replied that I did not know. He asked it three times. Then I saw Him put the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades, so that I experienced the coolness of His fingers between my nipples so everything became clear to me and I attained knowledge. He then addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ I replied, ‘Expiation.’ He asked what they were, and I replied, ‘Walking on foot to the congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers are over, and performing complete ablution in difficult circumstances. He asked what next they disputed about, and when I said it was about degrees, He asked what they were and I replied, ‘Providing food, speaking gently, and praying at night when people are asleep.’ He then told me to make a request, and I said, ‘O God, I ask Thee for power to do good things and abandon objectionable things, for love towards the poor, that Thou shouldest forgive me and show mercy to me, and that when Thou intendest to test any people Thou wilt take me to Thyself without being led astray. And I ask for Thy love, the love of those who love Thee, and a love of doing things which will bring me near to Thy love.’” Then God’s Messenger said, “It is true, so study it and learn it.” \n\nAhmad and Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Tirmidhi said, “This is a hasan sahih tradition.

This is a part of the prayers which comes at the end of every two rak'as, beginning with at-tahiyat lillah and ending with the testimony that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. Tahiyat is the plural of tahiya and the phrase quoted above is variously explained as meaning that endless existence, or dominion, or kingship, or freedom from all evils, or freedom from all causes of cessation of existence belong to God. Alternatively it is taken in its usual meaning of salutations.\n4. Saying, “The peace and mercy of God be upon you,” first with the head turned to the right and then with the head turned to the left.

At the end of two rak'as he stood up and said the takbir, raising his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders in the way he had said the takbir on beginning to pray; then he did that in the remainder of his prayer, and after the sajda* which is followed by the taslim he put out his left foot and sat on his left hip; then he uttered the taslim. They said, “You have spoken the truth. This is how he used to pray.” \n\n *i.e. prostration\n\nAbu Dawud and Darimi transmitted it. And Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted something to the same effect. Tirmidhi saying that this is a hasan sahih tradition.\n\nThen he bowed and placed his hands on his knees as though he were clutching them, and he bent his arms and kept them away from his sides. He (i.e. the narrator) said that he then prostrated himself placing his nose and his forehead on the ground, keeping his arms away from his sides, placing the palms of his hands [on the ground] opposite his shoulders, keeping his thighs separate and not letting his stomach press on any part of his thighs till he finished; then he sat up and spread out his left foot, putting forward the front of his right foot towards his qibla, placing the palm of his right hand on his right knee and the palm of his left hand on his left knee, and he pointed with his finger, i.e., his forefinger. In another version by him [it says]: When he sat at the end of two rak'as he sat on the sole of his left foot and raised the right, and after the fourth he placed his left hip on the ground and put out both feet on one side.\n\nA version by Abu Dawud of the tradition of Abu Humaid."

    "text": "Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone observes a prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur’an, it is deficient (he said this three times) and incomplete.” When someone asked Abu Huraira [what he should do] if he were led by an imam, he told him to recite it inwardly, for he had heard God’s Messenger declare that God most high had said, “I have divided the prayer into two halves between me and my servant, and my servant will receive what he asks.” When the servant says, “Praise be to God the Lord of the universe,” God most high says, “My servant has praised me.” When he says, “The Compassionate the Merciful,” God most high says, “My servant has lauded me.” When he says, “Possessor of the day of judgment,” He says, “My servant has glorified me.” When he says, “Thee do we worship and of Thee do we ask help,” He says, “This is between me and my servant, and my servant will receive what he asks.” Then when he says, “Guide us in the straight path, the path of those to whom Thou art generous, not of those with whom Thou art angry nor of those who go astray,” He says. “This is for my servant, and my servant will receive what he asks.” \n\nMuslim transmitted it."

What do you mean by looking at me?” They began to strike their hands on their thighs, and when I saw them urging me to be silent [I became angry],1 but I said nothing. When God’s Messenger finished his prayer (and I declare that neither before him nor after him have I seen a teacher who gave better instruction than he for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom), I swear by God that he did not scold, beat, or revile me, but said, “No talk to others is fitting during this prayer, for it consists only of glorifying God, declaring His greatness, and recitation of the Qur’an,” or words to that effect. I said, “Messenger of God, I have only recently been a pagan, but God has brought Islam to us, and among us there are men who have recourse to kahins.”2 He replied, “Do not have recourse to them.” I said, “Among us there are men who take omens.” He replied, “That is something which they find in their breasts, but let it not turn them away [from freedom of action]”. I said, “Among us there are men who draw lines.”3 He replied, “There was a prophet who drew lines, so if any do it as he did, that is allowable.” \n\n1. Some such phrase as that in brackets is required to complete the sense. It can be seen from the remarks at the end of the tradition that the text has been considered difficult.\n2. Diviners, soothsayers.\n3. The reference is to geomancy. The diviner draws many lines and obliterates them in pairs. If two are left it is a good sign, but if only one remains it indicates disappointment. The reference to the prophet may be a recollection of the statement in John 8:6 that Jesus wrote on the ground with his finger when the people asked what should be done with the woman caught in adultery; but this has no connection with geomancy.\n\nMuslim transmitted it. I found the phrase “But I said nothing” given thus in Muslim’s Sahih and al-Humaidi’s book. In Jami' al-usul it is stated to be correct, the word “thus”* being written above “but I.”\n*This corresponds to the use of (sic) to indicate an accurate quotation."

He then gave the salutation, then said “God is most great\" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great\", then said “God is most great\" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great\".

What is this man like?” and they would reply, \"He asserts that God has sent him, has made a revelation to him, has made a revelation to him to this effect.”I was remembering those words with the result that they seemed to be glued in my breast. By their acceptance of Islam the Arabs were expecting victory for they would say ‘Let him and his people alone, for if be gets the better of them, he is a true prophet.’ Then when the battle of the conquest of Mecca took place every tribe hastened to accept Islam, and my father was the first of my tribe to accept it. When he returned he said: I swear by God that I have come to you from him who is truly the Prophet. He said, “Pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and such and such a prayer at such and such a time. When the time of prayer comes one of you should call the >i>adhan and the one of you who knows most of the Qur’an should act as your imam” So they considered, and there was no one who knew more of the Our’an than I did because of what I had received from the riders. They therefore put me forward in front of them, and I was only six or seven years old. I wore a mantle which, when I prostrated myself, went up on me, and a woman of the clan said, “Why do you not cover the backside of your reader from us?” So they bought and cut out a shirt for me, and I have never been so pleased about anything as I was about that shirt. \n\nBukhari transmitted it."

The people were staying in the mosque waiting for the Prophet for the last evening prayer, so the Prophet sent instructions to Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. When the Messenger came to him and told him God’s Messenger was ordering him to lead the people in the prayer, Abu Bakr, who was a sensitive man, told ‘Umar to lead the people, but when ‘Umar replied, “You are more entitled to that,” Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days. Afterwards the Prophet experienced some improvement in his condition and went out between two men, one of whom was al-‘Abbas, to the noon prayer when Abu Bakr was leading the people. When Abu Bakr saw him he began to withdraw, but the Prophet signed to him not to do so. He told his two companions to set him down beside Abu Bakr, and they did so and he remained seated. ‘Ubaidallah said that he visited ‘Abdallah b. ‘Abbas and asked if he might submit to him what ‘A’isha had told him about the illness of God’s Messenger, and he said, “Go ahead.” He submitted to him what she had told and he objected to none of it, only asking whether she had named to him the man who accompanied al- ‘Abbas.

He would use the toothstick, perform ablution, and pray nine rak'as, sitting only during the eighth of them, then he would make mention of God, praise and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth. After that he would sit, make mention of God, praise and supplicate Him, then utter a salutation loud enough for me to hear. He would then pray two rak'as sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'as, sonny. But when God’s Messenger grew old and became fleshy he observed a witr of seven, doing in the two rak'as, as he had done formerly, and that made nine, sonny. When God’s prophet prayed a prayer he liked to keep on observing it, but when sleep or pain made it impossible for him to get up during the night; he prayed twelve rak'as during the day. I am not aware of God’s prophet having recited the whole Qur’an in a night, or praying through a whole night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan.” \n\n*i.e. the good characteristics included in the Qur’an were shown by the Prophet in his own life.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."

Abu Huraira said: I met ‘Abdallah b. Salam and told him of my meeting with Ka'b al-Ahbar and of what I had told him about Friday, telling him that Ka'b had said that was one day every year. ‘Abdallah b. Salam said that Ka'b had lied, but when I told him that Ka'b afterwards read the Torah and said that it was every Friday he said that Ka'b had spoken the truth. ‘Abdallah b. Salam then said that he knew what time it was, and when I asked him to tell me about it and not keep it to himself he replied that it was at the very end of Friday. I asked how that could be when God's Messenger had said, “No Muslim will pray in it . . . and he asked me if God’s Messenger had not said, “If anyone is seated waiting for the prayer he is engaged in the prayer until he observes it.\" When I replied that that was so he said that that was how it came about. \n\nMalik, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi and Nasa’i transmitted it, and Ahmad transmitted it up to the statement that Ka'b had spoken the truth."

While Bukhari, al-'amal fis salat, 8, gives a tradition which allows smoothing the ground once only, this tradition treats the matter as unsuitable. Regarding this tradition Lisan al-'Arab, 22:118, says that lagha means ‘he has spoken', or ‘deviated from what is right,‘ or ‘has been frustrated', adding that the first is the basic meaning. The idea is evidently that the one who makes a sound by removing small stones during the prayer has hindered someone from hearing. Cf. Qur'an, 41:26.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."

God’s Messenger then stood up and led us in prayer, and one section stood up along with him while another faced the enemy. He prayed a rak'a with those who were with him and made two prostrations, and then they changed places with those who had not prayed. When they came God’s Messenger prayed a rak'a with them and made two prostrations, then he uttered the salutation and each of them got up and left, after which he prayed a rak'a alone and made two prostrations. Nafi‘ transmitted something similar, adding that when there was greater cause for fear than on that occasion they prayed standing on their feet or mounted, without considering whether or not they were facing the qibla. Nafi‘ said he thought God’s Messenger was the one on whose authority Ibn ‘Umar mentioned that. \n\nBukhari transmitted it."

If he had cause to send out an expedition he mentioned it to the people, or if he required anything else he gave them commands about it, and he would say, “Give alms, give alms, give alms.\" Those who gave most were the women. Then he would go away. This practice went on till the time of Marwan b. al-Hakam.* I went out hand in hand with Marwan, and when we came to the place of prayer we saw that Kathir b. as Salt had built a pulpit of clay and brick. Marwan began to tug me with his hand as though he were pulling me towards the pulpit, while I was pulling him towards the prayer. When I saw what he was doing I said, “What has happened to the practice of beginning with prayer?\" He replied, “No, Abu Sa'id, what you are familiar with has been abandoned.\" I thereupon said three times, “By no means, by Him in whose hand my soul is, you are not doing something better than what I am familiar with.\" Then he went away. \n\n*Ummayyad Caliph, 64-65 A.H.\n\nMuslim transmitted it."
