God’s messenger showed signs of anger on\nhis face because of the poverty-stricken state in which he saw them,\nand went in. After a little he came out and gave orders to Bilal who\nuttered the call to prayer and announced that the time to begin prayer\nhad come. When the Prophet had prayed, he delivered an address in \nwhich he said, “ ‘Fear your Lord, people, who created you from one\nsoul . . . God watches over you.’[Qur’an, iv, 1] ‘Fear God, and let a soul look to\nwhat it has sent forward for the morrow. [Ibid., lix, 18] Let a man give sadaqa\nfrom his dinars and dirhams, his clothing, his sa‘ of wheat and sa‘ of\ndates, even if it is only half a date.” Jarir said: One of the Ansar\nbrought a purse which was almost too big for his hand to hold, indeed\nit was too big. Then people came one after the other till I saw two\nmounds of food and clothing, with the result that I saw the face of God’s\nmessenger glowing as if it were golden. He then said, “If anyone establishes a good sunna in Islam he will have a reward for it and the\nequivalent of the rewards of those who act upon it after him, without\ntheirs being diminished in any respect; but he who establishes a bad\nsunna in Islam will bear the responsibility of it and the responsibility\nof those who act upon it after him, without theirs being diminished in\nany respect.” Muslim transmitted it. \n*[The text has an-nimar au al-'aba, thus giving an alternative word.
