I reached Madina during the night and went straight to him. I am someone with intelligence and a ready tongue - or he said speech (meaning eloquence). I had looked at this world and thought little of it. I had abandoned it as not being worth anything. At 'Umar's side there was a man with white hair and white clothes. When I had finished speaking, he said, \"All that you have said is correct except for your attack on this world. Do you know what this world is? This world is that in which we reach (or he said, 'where our provision is') the Next World. It contains our actions for which we will be rewarded in the Next World.\" He said, \"A man who knows this world better than I do worked in it.\" I asked, \"Amir al-Mu'minin, who is this man at our side?\" He replied, 'The master of the Muslims, Ubayy ibn Ka'b.'\""
