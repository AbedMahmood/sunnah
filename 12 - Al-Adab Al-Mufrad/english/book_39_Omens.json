When he finished, he faced the people and said, 'Do you know what your Lord has said?' They replied, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'This morning My slaves have become divided up into believers and unbelievers. Those who said, \"We had rain by the favour and mercy of Allah,\" believe in Me and reject the stars. Those who said that it was because of a certain star, disbelieve in Me and believe in the stars.\"'\""
