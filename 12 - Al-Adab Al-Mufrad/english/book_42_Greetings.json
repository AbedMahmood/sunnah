He said, \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had a twig in his hand with which he was striking the water and mud. A man came and asked for the garden to be opened, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Open it for him and give him the good news of the Garden.' I went and it was Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him. I opened the gate for him and gave him the good news of the Garden. Then another man asked to be let in and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Open the door and give him the good news of the Garden.' It was 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, and I let him in and gave him the good news of the Garden. Then yet another man asked to be let in. The Prophet had been reclining, but he then sat up and said, 'Open it for him and give him the good news of the Garden along with an affliction which will befall him ? or which will happen.' I went and it was 'Uthman, I opened the door and told him what the Prophet had said. He said, 'Allah is the One who is asked for help. '\""
