He said, \"When we set out, I told myself, 'By Allah, I will go to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so that I will have more knowledge. I went in the evening until I was in front of him. I asked, 'What do you command me to do?' He replied, 'Harmala, do what is correct and avoid the incorrect.' Then I went back to the caravan. Then I came back again until I was in my place near him. I asked, 'Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do?' He replied, 'Harmala, do what is correct and avoid the incorrect. Find out what you like to hear people tell you when you are with them. When you leave me, behave in that manner. Find out what you dislike for people to day to you. When you leave me, avoid that.' When I returned, I thought that these two statements did not omit anything.\""
