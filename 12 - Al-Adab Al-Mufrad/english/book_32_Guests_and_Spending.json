    "text": "Muhammad bin Ziyad said that he found that the predecessors (that is, the companions and their successors) lived together with their families. When a guest of one of them arrived and he found the cooking pot of another on the stove, he would take it serve his guest from it. When the owner of the cooking pot found it missing, he would enquire and the man who had taken it would tell him that he took it for his guest. There upon the owner would exclaim.\" May Allah bless it for you,\" or he would make a similar exclamation.\n\nAnd Muhammad said, when bread was baked (the one with the guest would take all of it). Their homes were separated by walls made of canes\".\n\nA narration of the Hadith, Baqiyyah, said,\" I too found (my teacher) Muhammad bin Ziyad and his colleagues observe this practice."

The narrator asked,\" what is his Jaizah, O messenger of Allah?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said,\" his Jaizah, extends over one day and one night while (general) hospitality extends over three days. And beyond that t(that is after three days) is counted as Sadaqah (meaning, whatever the host spends after three days on his guest will be under the head of Sadaqah because hospitality ends at three days). And he who believes in Allah and the last day should speak a good word or keep silent.\""

I sat down to wait for him and he came with two camels. One of them was lined up behind the other and each of the camels had a waterskin on its neck. Abu Dharr took them off. Then he came and I said, 'Abu Dharr! There was no man who I desired to meet more than you and there was none that I hated to meet more than you!' He said, 'Your father is for Allah! How can these two be joined together?' I replied, 'In the Jahiliyya, a buried a daughter alive and I feared that I would meet you and you would say, \"There is no way for you to repent. There is no way out.\" On the other hand, I used to hope that you would say, \"There is a way for you to repent. There is a way out.\"' He asked,\" Did you do that in the Jahiliyah?\" And Nuaym said \"Yes.\". Abu Dharr (ra) said,\" Allah has forgiven the sins committed earlier (before the Islamic times)\". He then said to his wife,\" Bring us the meal.\" But she refused to do so. He then commanded her but she again refused to bring it and their voices were soon raised. Abu Dharr (ra) said,\" You will not go beyond what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said\". Nuaym asked,\" What has the Messenger of Allah said about them?\" Abu Dharr (ra) said,\" The Messenger of Allah has said that a woman is created from a crooked rib and if you attempt to straighten it you will break it but if you leave her alone you will enjoy her while the crookedness remains in her\". His wife then turned her back to them and went away and brought thareed as though she matched the bird Qatah (in swiftness). He then said,\" you go ahead, eat the food. And do not worry (about eating alone). For I am fasting,\" he stood up to offer prayers and hurried to the bowing posture. After he had finished his prayer, he began to eat. Nuaym exclaimed, \"We belong to Allah! I had given no thought to it that you would lie to me. You said just now that you were fasting and you have come to eat\". He said,\"Your father is for Allah! Ever since I have met you, I have not spoken a lie.\" Nuaym said, \"Did you not tell me that you were fasting?\" He said,\"Yes. I have kept three fasts in this month so that the reward for it is written down for me while it is lawful for me to eat too."
