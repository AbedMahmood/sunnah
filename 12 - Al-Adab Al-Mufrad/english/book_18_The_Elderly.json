'Abdullah ibn Sahl was murdered. 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Sahl and Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa, the sons of Mas'ud came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and spoke to him about their (murdered) companion. 'Abdu'r-Rahman, the youngest of those present, began to speak, but the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Let the oldest speak first.\" (or \"Exalt the eldest.\") They spoke about their companion and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked, \"Will fifty of you take an oath that you are entitled to the blood-money of your murdered man?\" They replied, \"Messenger of Allah, this is something which we did not see.\" He said, \"Then will the Jews exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them?\" They protested, \"Messenger of Allah, they are unbelievers!\" So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, himself paid his blood money.\""

It gives fruits at all times by the permission of its Lord and its leaves do not fall.' It occurred to me that it was the palm tree, but I did not want to speak as Abu Bakr and 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, were both present. When they did not speak, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'It is the palm tree.' When I left with my father, I said, 'Father, I thought that it was the palm,.' He asked, 'What kept you from saying that? If you had said so, I would have preferred that to such-and-such.' I said, 'What kept me from doing so was that I did not see you or Abu Bakr speak, so I did not like to speak out.'\""

It is an impetus for the generous and it will make you independent of critics. Beware of asking people. It is a man's last source of earning. When I die, do not wail. There was no wailing for the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When I die, bury me in a land where the Bakr ibn Wa'il will not know where I am buried.
