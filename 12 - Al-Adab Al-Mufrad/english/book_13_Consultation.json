    "text": "\"Do you have a servant?\" \"No,\" he replied. He said, \"Come to us when we get some captives.\" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was brought only two captives. Abu'l-Haytham came to him and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Choose between them.\" \"Choose for me, Messenger of Allah,\" he replied. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"The person who is consulted is in a position of trust. Take this one. I have seen him pray. Treat him well.\" Abu'l-Haytham's wife said, \"You will not live up to the words of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about him until you set him free.\" \"He is free,\" he stated. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Allah did not send a Prophet or khalifa but that he has two confidants: a confidant who commands him to do what is correct and forbids what is bad, and a confidant who will not fall short in corrupting you. Anyone who is protected from the evil confidant has been protected.\""
