(They are grave sins though on the face of it they are ordinary and it is easy to avoid them but their punishment is severe.) One of them was given to backbite other people while the other was not. Careful to clean himself of urine drops (over his body)\". He then asked for one or two branches of fresh date palm and split them and dug them on each grave. He said afterwards,\" Soon their punishment will be softened as long as the branches are green.\" Or he said, “Until they dry up.”"

    "text": "It is reported by Abu Hurayrah (ra) that Maiz bin Maalik al-Aslami (ra) came to the Prophet (ﷺ) repeatedly (so that he may be given the prescribed punishment for the sin he had committed). When he came the fourth time, the Prophet (ﷺ) gave orders for Rajam and he was stoned to death. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and a few of his companions afterwards passed by him. One of the companions remarked,\" How many times this perished man came to the Prophet, and each time he turned him away until he was stoned like a dog.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) did not say anything and walked ahead till they came to the corpse of a donkey with its legs in the air. He said,\"Eat some of this (corpse).\" They asked \"Messenger of Allah, from this dead donkey?\" He said to them.\" That you have just backbited your brother is more serious than eating some of it (the donkey's corpse). By him in whose hand the soul of Muhammad is, he (Mariz bin Maalik) is now among the rivers of paradise plunging into it\"."

    "text": "Ubadah bin Walid said that he came out with his father Ubadah bin al-Samit and he was a young man at that time. They met an elderly Shaikh who had a mantle over him and Maafi garments. His slave too had a mantle and Maafai. The narrator (Ubadah bin Walid) said,\" My uncle! In this way, you would have had a pair of good quality garments and he would have had one striped mantle\". The man turned to Ubadah bin al-Samit and asked,\" Is he your son?\" He said,\" yes\" Ubadah bin Walid said that the Shaikh stroked his head and said,\" May Allah bless you! I bear testimony that I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say that we must feed the slaves the same thing that we eat and clothe them that which we wear. O son of my brother! It is more dear to me that I lose the possessions of this world than I lose anything of the hereafter\". Ubadah bin Walid asked his father who the Shaikh was and he said.\" He is Abu al-Yasr Kab bin Amr\""
