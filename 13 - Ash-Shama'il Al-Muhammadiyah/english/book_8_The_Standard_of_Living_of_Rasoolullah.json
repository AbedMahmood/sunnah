    "text": "Muhammad ibn Sirin said: We were in the presence of Abu Huraira, and he was wearing two linen garments dyed with red clay. He blew his nose in one of them, then said: “Bravo! Bravo! Abu Huraira is blowing his nose in the linen! I had found myself (in the past) as I would drop between the pulpit of Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) and the room of 'A'isha (may Allah be well pleased with her) falling unconscious, so the one who would come (by) would come then plant his foot on my neck, supposing I was afflicted with insanity, though I was not afflicted with insanity, and it was merely hunger.”"
