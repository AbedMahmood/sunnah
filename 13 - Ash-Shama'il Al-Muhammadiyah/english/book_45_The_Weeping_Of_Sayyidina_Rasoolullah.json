O my Lord, have You not promised me that You will not torment them while they and we are appealing to You for forgiveness?' Then, once he had performed two cycles of ritual prayer, the sun became visible, so he stood up, praised Allah (Exalted is He) and extolled Him. Then he said: 'The sun and the moon are among the signs of Allah. They are not eclipsed because of someone’s death, nor because of his coming to life, so when they are eclipsed, you must seek refuge in the remembrance of Allah (Exalted is He)!'”"
