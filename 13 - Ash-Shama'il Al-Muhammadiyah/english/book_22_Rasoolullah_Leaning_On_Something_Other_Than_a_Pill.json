    "text": "Al-Fadl ibn Abbas said: \"I went in to see Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) during his illness in which he died, and on his head there was a yellow band. I greeted him with the salutation of peace, so he said: 'O Fadl!”'I said: 'Doubly at your service, O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Wrap my head firmly with this band!' I acted accordingly, then he sat and placed the palm of his hand on my shoulder. Then he stood up and entered the mosque.” (This tradition is part of a longer story.)"
