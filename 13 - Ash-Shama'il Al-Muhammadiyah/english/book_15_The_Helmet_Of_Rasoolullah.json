When he took it off, a man came to him and told him: ‘Ibn Khatal [the son of corrupt speech] is clinging to the curtains of the Ka'ba,’ so he said: ‘Kill him!’ Ibn Shihab said: ‘It has also reached me that Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) was not in the state of ritual consecration on that day.’”"
