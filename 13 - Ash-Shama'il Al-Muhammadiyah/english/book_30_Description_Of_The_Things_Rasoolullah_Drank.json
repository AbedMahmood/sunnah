    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas said (may Allah be well pleased with him and his father): \"Together with Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace), Khalid ibn al-Walid and I entered the presence of Maimuna, whereupon she brought us a vessel of milk and Allah’s Messenger drank (Allah bless him and give him peace), while I was on his right side and Khalid was on his left. He said to me: 'The drink is yours, but if you wish, you may let Khalid have it.' I said: 'I wouldn't give up your leftover drink for anyone!' Then Allah’s Messenger said (Allah bless him and give him peace): 'If Allah feeds someone a meal, let him say: ‘O Allah, bless us in it, and give us something even better!’ If Allah (Almighty and Glorious is He) gives a person some milk to drink, let him say: ‘O Allah, bless us in it, and grant us more of it!’ Then Allah’s Messenger said (Allah bless him and give him peace): 'Nothing but milk can substitute for both food and drink'!\""
