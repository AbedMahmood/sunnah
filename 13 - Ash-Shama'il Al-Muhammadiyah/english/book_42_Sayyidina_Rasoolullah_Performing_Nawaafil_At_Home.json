    "text": "Abdu’llah ibn Sa'd said: \"I asked Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) about performing the ritual prayer in my home, and performing it in the mosque.\" He said: “You may notice how near my home is to the mosque. I prefer praying at home over praying in the mosque, except in the case of a prescribed ritual prayer.”"
