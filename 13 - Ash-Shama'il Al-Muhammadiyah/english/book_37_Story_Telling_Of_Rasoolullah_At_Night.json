    "text": "'Ai'sha said: \"Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) told his wives a story one night, and one of them said: “It sounds like a fable of Khurafa!” He said: “Do you know what that means? Khurafa was a man from [the Yemenite tribe of] 'Udhra. The jinn captured him in the pagan era [al-jahiliyya], so he stayed with them for a long time, then they returned him to his people. He used to tell the people about the marvels that he saw among them, so the people said: ‘The fable of Khurafa.'”"
