So I said to the slave girl: “Overturn her bowl.” She went and caught up with her, and she was about to put (the bowl) in front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She overturned it and the bowl broke, scattering the food. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gathered the pieces and the food on the leather mat and they ate. Then he sent for my bowl and gave it to Hafsah, and said: “Take this pot in place of your pot, and eat what is in it.” And I did not see any expression of anger on the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' ”"
