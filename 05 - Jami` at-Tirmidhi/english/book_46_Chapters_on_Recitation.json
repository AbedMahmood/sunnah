I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited it in several different ways, which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his Salat, but waited until he said the Salam. When he had said the Salam, I strangled him with his upper-garment and said: 'Who taught you this Surah which I heard you reciting?' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me.' I said to him: 'You lie! By Allah! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me this Surah which you were reciting.' I dragged him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! I heard this one reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a manner different from how you taught me, and you taught me Surat Al-Furqan.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Release him O 'Umar! Recite O Hisham.' So he recited it for him as I had heard him reciting. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: 'This is how it was revealed.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, 'Recite O 'Umar.' So I recited the recitation which the Prophet (ﷺ) taught me. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'This is how it was revealed.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said 'Indeed this Qur'an was revealed in seven modes, so recite of it what is easier for you.'\"\n\nNarrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:\n\"I passed by Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam while he was reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).
