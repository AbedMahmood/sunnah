I did not know what to say. So I went to the house of Abdullah bin Umar and I sought permission to enter. I was told that he was taking a nap, but he heard me talking and he said: 'Is it Ibn Jubair? Enter. You would not have come except for a need.'\"He said: \"So I entered and found him lying on a saddlecloth from his mount. I said: 'O Abu Abdur-Rahman! Are those involved in Li'an separated?' He said: 'Glorious is Allah! Yes. The first who asked about that was so-and-so the son of so-and-so. He came to the Prophet and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! If one of us saw his wife committing adultery what should he do? If he were to say anything, his statement would be a horrible matter, and if he were to remain silent, his silence about the matter would be horrible.\" \"He said: 'So the Prophet remained silent and did not answer him. Afterwards he came to the Prophet and said: \"The one who asked you about it has been tried by it.\" So Allah revealed these Ayat from Surat An-Nur. And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves - until the end of those Ayat. So he called for the man and recited the Ayat to him and admonished him, reminded him, and he told him: \"Indeed the punishment of the world is less than the punishment of the Hereafter.\" So he said: \"Nay! By the One Who sent you with the truth! I did not lie about her.\" Then he did the same with the woman, admonished her and reminding her and he told her: \"Indeed the punishment of the world is less than the punishment of the Hereafter.\" She said: \"Nay!
