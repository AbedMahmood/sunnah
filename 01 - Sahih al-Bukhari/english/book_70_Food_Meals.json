Maimuna presented the mastigure before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who rarely started eating any (unfamiliar) food before it was described and named for him. (But that time) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stretched his hand towards the (meat of the) mastigure whereupon a lady from among those who were present, said, \"You should inform Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what you have presented to him. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is the meat of a mastigure.\" (On learning that) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) withdrew his hand from the meat of the mastigure. Khalid bin Al-Walid said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is this unlawful to eat?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"No, but it is not found in the land of my people, so I do not like it.\" Khalid said, \"Then I pulled the mastigure (meat) towards me and ate it while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was looking at me."
