I asked about the reason for it. He replied, \"I abused a person by calling his mother with bad names.\" The Prophet said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him by calling his mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of ignorance. Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has put them under your command.
