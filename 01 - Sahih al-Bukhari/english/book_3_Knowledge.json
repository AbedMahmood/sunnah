Ubai bin Ka`b said: \"Yes, I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) mentioning something about him (saying) while Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked him: \"Do you know anyone who is more learned than you? Moses replied: \"No.\" So Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: '--Yes, Our slave Khadir is more learned than you. Moses asked Allah how to meet him (Al-Khadir). So Allah made the fish a sign for him and he was told when the fish was lost, he should return (to the place where he had lost it) and there he would meet him (Al-Khadir). So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea.
