He, his elder brother Huwaiyisa and `Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl came (to the Prophet) and he who had been at Khaibar, proceeded to speak, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said to Muhaiyisa, \"The eldest! The eldest!\" meaning, \"Let the eldest of you speak.\" So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then Muhaiyisa. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The Jews should either pay the blood money of your (deceased) companion or be ready for war.\" After that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wrote a letter to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote that they had not killed him. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Huwaiyisa, Muhaiyisa and `Abdur-Rahman, \"Can you take an oath by which you will be entitled to take the blood money?\" They said, \"No.\" He said (to them), \"Shall we ask the Jews to take an oath before you?\" They replied, \"But the Jews are not Muslims.\" So Allah's Apostle gave them one-hundred she-camels as blood money from himself. Sahl added: When those she-camels were made to enter the house, one of them kicked me with its leg."
