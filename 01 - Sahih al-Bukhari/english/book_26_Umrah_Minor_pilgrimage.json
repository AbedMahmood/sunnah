Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka`ba and the Sa`i between Safa and Marwa). \"\n\nNarrated Safwan bin Ya`la bin Umaiya from his father who said:\n\"A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was at Ji'rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet (ﷺ) ), 'What do you order me to perform in my `Umra?' So, Allah inspired the Prophet (ﷺ) divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet (ﷺ) being divinely inspired. `Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet (ﷺ) while Allah is inspiring him?' I replied in the affirmative. `Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet (ﷺ) who was snoring.
