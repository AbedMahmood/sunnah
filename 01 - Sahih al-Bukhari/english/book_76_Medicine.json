There was a multitude of people filling the horizon. Then it was said to me, 'Look there and there about the stretching sky! Behold! There was a multitude filling the horizon,' It was said to me, 'This is your nation out of whom seventy thousand shall enter Paradise without reckoning.' \"Then the Prophet (ﷺ) entered his house without telling his companions who they (the 70,000) were. So the people started talking about the issue and said, \"It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.'' When the Prophet (ﷺ) heard of that, he came out and said. \"Those people are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord \" On that 'Ukasha bin Muhsin said. \"Am I one of them, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" Then another person got up and said, \"Am I one of them?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Ukasha has anticipated you.\""

Those people differed in their opinions. Some of them said, \"We have come out for a purpose and we do not think that it is proper to give it up,\" while others said (to `Umar), \"You have along with you. other people and the companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so do not advise that we take them to this epidemic.\" `Umar said to them, \"Leave me now.\" Then he said, \"Call the Ansar for me.\" I called them and he consulted them and they followed the way of the emigrants and differed as they did. He then said to them, Leave me now,\" and added, \"Call for me the old people of Quraish who emigrated in the year of the Conquest of Mecca.\" I called them and they gave a unanimous opinion saying, \"We advise that you should return with the people and do not take them to that (place) of epidemic.\" So `Umar made an announcement, \"I will ride back to Medina in the morning, so you should do the same.\" Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah said (to `Umar), \"Are you running away from what Allah had ordained?\" `Umar said, \"Would that someone else had said such a thing, O Abu 'Ubaida! Yes, we are running from what Allah had ordained to what Allah has ordained. Don't you agree that if you had camels that went down a valley having two places, one green and the other dry, you would graze them on the green one only if Allah had ordained that, and you would graze them on the dry one only if Allah had ordained that?\" At that time `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, who had been absent because of some job, came and said, \"I have some knowledge about this. I have heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'If you hear about it (an outbreak of plague) in a land, do not go to it; but if plague breaks out in a country where you are staying, do not run away from it.' \" `Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina."
