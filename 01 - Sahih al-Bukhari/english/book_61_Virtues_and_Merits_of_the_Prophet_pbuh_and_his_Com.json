We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca, claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, 'Go to that man and talk to him and bring me his news.' He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, 'What is the news with you?' He said, 'By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.' I said to him, 'You have not satisfied me with this little information.' So, I took a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and staying in the Mosque. Then `Ali passed by me and said, 'It seems you are a stranger?' I said, 'Yes.' He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. `Ali passed by me again and asked, 'Hasn't the man recognized his dwelling place yet' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Come along with me.' He asked me, 'What is your business? What has brought you to this town?' I said to him, 'If you keep my secret, I will tell you.' He said, 'I will do,' I said to him, 'We have heard that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally.' `Ali said (to Abu Dhar), 'You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.' `Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet (ﷺ) to whom I said, 'Present (the principles of) Islam to me.'

I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah's Slave and His Apostle.' (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, 'Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !' They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al `Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me.

He asked, \"With some food? I said, \"Yes\" Allah's Apostle then said to the men around him, \"Get up!\" He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet's visit). Abu Talha said, \"O Um Sulaim! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.\" She said, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" So Abu Talha went out to receive Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.\" She brought the bread which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, \"Let ten persons come (to share the meal).\" Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he again said, \"Let another ten do the same.\" They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he again said, '\"'Let another ten persons (do the same.)\" They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he said, \"Let another ten persons come.\" In short, all of them ate their fill, and they were seventy or eighty men."

He said to `Azib. \"Tell your son to carry it with me.\" So I carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My father said, \"O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (during Migration).\" He said, \"Yes, we travelled the whole night and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet (ﷺ) to sleep on (for a while). I then said, 'Sleep, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and I will guard you.' So he slept and I went out to guard him. Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we had when we came to it. I asked (him). 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He replied, 'I belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.' I said, 'Do your sheep have milk?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you milk for us?' He said, 'Yes.' He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara' striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather container which I carried for the Prophet (ﷺ) to drink and perform the ablution from. I went to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet (ﷺ) had already awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was cold. Then I said, 'Drink, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked, 'Has the time for our departure come?' I said, 'Yes.' So we departed after midday. Suraqa bin Malik followed us and I said, 'We have been discovered, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He said, Don't grieve for Allah is with us.' The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not sure whether Abu Bakr said, \"(It sank) into solid earth.\") Suraqa said, 'I see that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause those who are seeking after you to return.' The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked good on him and he was saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, 'I have looked for him here in vain.' So he caused whomever he met to return.

Umaiya said to Sa`d, \"Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka`ba?\" So, while Sa`d was going around the Ka`ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, \"Who is that who is performing Tawaf?\" Sa`d replied, \"I am Sa`d.\" Abu Jahl said, \"Are you circumambulating the Ka`ba safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?\" Sa`d said, \"Yes,\" and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sa`d, \"Don't shout at Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).\" Sa`d then said (to Abu Jahl). 'By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka`ba, I will spoil your trade with Sham.\" Umaiya kept on saying to Sa`d, \"Don't raise your voice.\" and kept on taking hold of him.
