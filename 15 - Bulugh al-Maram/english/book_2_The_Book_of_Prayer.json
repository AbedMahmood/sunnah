It lasts until the time of the 'Asr (afternoon) prayer. The time of the 'Asr prayer is as long as the sun has not become yellow (during its setting). The time of the Maghrib (sunset) prayer is as long as the twilight has not disappeared. The time of the 'Isha' (night) prayer is up to midnight. And the time of the Fajr (morning) prayer is from the appearance of dawn as long as the sun has not risen; (but when the sun rises abstain from prayer; for it rises between the two horns of Satan).\" [Reported by Muslim]."

When he raised his head from the bowing position, he did not prostrate till he had stood erect; and when he raised his head after a prostration, he did not prostrate again till he had sat up. And at the end of every two Rak'ah he said the Tahiyyah, and he used to sit on his left foot and position he right one vertically, and he prohibited the devil's way of sitting on the buttocks. He forbade people to spread out their arms like a wild beast. And he used to finish the prayer with the Taslim (i.e. saying As-Salamu 'alaikum). [Reported by Muslim and it has an 'illa (defect)]."

Then, he offered two Rak'at in the same way he prayed 'Eid, but did not deliver your kind of Khutbah (religious talk, sermon).

He then fixed a day for the people to come out. And he (ﷺ) came out when the edge of the sun appeared, sat down on the Minbar pronounced the greatness of Allah and expressed His praise. Then, he said, \"You have complained of drought in your abodes. Allah has ordered you to supplicate Him, and promised that He would answer (your supplications).\" Then he (ﷺ) said: All Praise is due to Allah, the Rabb (Lord) of the universe, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Master of the Day of Judgement; nothing deserves to be worshipped except Allah, Who does what He wills. O Allah! You are Allah, nothing deserves to be worshipped except You; You are the Rich, and we are the poor; send down rain upon us and make what You send down strength and satisfaction for a time.\" He (ﷺ) then raised his hands and kept rising them till the whiteness of his armpits was visible. He then turned his back to the people and inverted his cloak while keeping his hands raised. He (ﷺ) then faced the people, descended and prayed two Rak'at. Then, Allah produced a cloud and storms of thunder and lightning came and the rain fell. [Reported by Abu Dawud who graded it Gharib (transmitted through a single narrator), but its chain is Jayyid (good)]."
