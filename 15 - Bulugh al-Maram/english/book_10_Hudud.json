I beseech you by Allah, that you judge between us according to Allah's laws' The man's opponent who was wiser than him got up and said, 'Yes, judge between us according to Allah's Law and kindly allow me (to speak).' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Speak.\" He said, 'My son was a laborer working for that man (the Bedouin) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I was informed that my son deserved to be stoned to death (as punishment for this offence). I ransomed him with one hundred sheep and a slave girl. But when I asked the knowledgeable people they told me that my son should receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for a year, and the man's wife should be stoned to death. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied, \"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I shall judge between you according to the Law of Allah (i.e. His Book). The slave girl and the sheep are to be returned to you. As for your son, he has to receive one hundred lashes and be exiled for a year. O Unais!
