    "text": "Ibn Umar reported that 'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) expelled the Jews and Christians from the land of Hijaz, and that when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) conquered Khaibar he made up his mind to expel the Jews from it (the territory of Khaibar) because, when that land was conquered, it came under the sway of Allah, that of His Messenger (ﷺ) and that of the Muslims. The jews asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to let them continue there on the condition that they would work on it, and would get in turn half of the fruit (of the trees), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:\nWe would let you continue there so long as we will desire. So they continued (to cultivate the lands) till 'Umar externed them to Taima' ang Ariha (two villages in Arabia, but out of Hijaz)."

You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do it (i. e. exchange superior quality of dates for inferior quality) ; so you should sell your dates for another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you like. Abu Sa'ad said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is exchanged for gold having different qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn 'Umar and he forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn 'Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them).
